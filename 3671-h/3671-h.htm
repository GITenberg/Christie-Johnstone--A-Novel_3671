      <br /> <br /> NOTE.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIS story was written three years ago, and one or two topics in it are
      not treated exactly as they would be if written by the same hand to-day.
      But if the author had retouched those pages with his colors of 1853, he
      would (he thinks) have destroyed the only merit they have, viz., that of
      containing genuine contemporaneous verdicts upon a cant that was
      flourishing like a peony, and a truth that was struggling for bare life,
      in the year of truth 1850.
    </p>
    <p>
      He prefers to deal fairly with the public, and, with this explanation and
      apology, to lay at its feet a faulty but genuine piece of work.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      VISCOUNT IPSDEN, aged twenty-five, income eighteen thousand pounds per
      year, constitution equine, was unhappy! This might surprise some people;
      but there are certain blessings, the non-possession of which makes more
      people discontented than their possession renders happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foremost among these are "Wealth and Rank." Were I to add "Beauty" to the
      list, such men and women as go by fact, not by conjecture, would hardly
      contradict me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fortunate man is he who, born poor, or nobody, works gradually up to
      wealth and consideration, and, having got them, dies before he finds they
      were not worth so much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden started with nothing to win; and naturally lived for
      amusement. Now nothing is so sure to cease to please as pleasure&mdash;to
      amuse, as amusement. Unfortunately for himself he could not at this period
      of his life warm to politics; so, having exhausted his London clique, he
      rolled through the cities of Europe in his carriage, and cruised its
      shores in his yacht. But he was not happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of taste, and sipped the arts and other knowledge, as he
      sauntered Europe round.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I do?" said <i>l'ennuye'.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Distinguish yourself," said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No immediate answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a <i>prima donna</i> over," said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the man took a <i>prima donna</i> over, which scolded its maid from
      the Alps to Dover in the <i>lingua Toscana</i> without the <i>bocca
      Romana,</i> and sang in London without applause; because what goes down at
      La Scala does not generally go down at Il Teatro della Regina, Haymarket.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then my lord strolled into Russia; there he drove a pair of horses, one
      of whom put his head down and did the work; the other pranced and
      capricoled alongside, all unconscious of the trace. He seemed happier than
      his working brother; but the biped whose career corresponded with this
      playful animal's was not happy!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length an event occurred that promised to play an adagio upon Lord
      Ipsden 's mind. He fell in love with Lady Barbara Sinclair; and he had no
      sooner done this than he felt, as we are all apt to do on similar
      occasions, how wise a thing he had done!
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides a lovely person, Lady Barbara Sinclair had a character that he saw
      would make him; and, in fact, Lady Barbara Sinclair was, to an
      inexperienced eye, the exact opposite of Lord Ipsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mental impulse was as plethoric as his was languid.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as enthusiastic as he was cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a warm interest in everything. She believed that government is a
      science, and one that goes with <i>copia verborum.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed that, in England, government is administered, not by a set of
      men whose salaries range from eighty to five hundred pounds a year, and
      whose names are never heard, but by the First Lord of the Treasury, and
      other great men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence she inferred, that it matters very much to all of us in whose hand
      is the rudder of that state vessel which goes down the wind of public
      opinion, without veering a point, let who will be at the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also cared very much who was the new bishop. Religion&mdash;if not
      religion, theology&mdash;would be affected thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was enthusiastic about poets; imagined their verse to be some sort of
      clew to their characters, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had other theories, which will be indicated by and by; at present it
      is enough to say that her mind was young, healthy, somewhat original, full
      of fire and faith, and empty of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden loved her! it was easy to love her.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was not, in the whole range of her mind and body, one grain
      of affectation of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always, in point of fact, under the influence of some male mind or
      other, generally some writer. What young woman is not, more or less, a
      mirror? But she never imitated or affected; she was always herself, by
      whomsoever colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was beautiful and eloquent; much too high-bred to put a restraint
      upon her natural manner, she was often more <i>naive,</i> and even brusk,
      than your would-be aristocrats dare to be; but what a charming abruptness
      hers was!
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not excel in descriptions, and yet I want to give you some carnal
      idea of a certain peculiarity and charm this lady possessed; permit me to
      call a sister art to my aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has lately stepped upon the French stage a charming personage, whose
      manner is quite free from the affectation that soils nearly all French
      actresses&mdash;Mademoiselle Madeleine Brohan! When you see this young
      lady play Mademoiselle La Segli'ere, you see high-bred sensibility
      personified, and you see something like Lady Barbara Sinclair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a connection of Lord Ipsden's, but they had not met for two years,
      when they encountered each other in Paris just before the commencement of
      this "Dramatic Story," "Novel" by courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month he spent in Paris, near her, was a bright month to Lord Ipsden.
      A bystander would not have gathered, from his manner, that he was warmly
      in love with this lady; but, for all that, his lordship was gradually
      uncoiling himself, and gracefully, quietly basking in the rays of Barbara
      Sinclair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also just beginning to take an interest in subjects of the day&mdash;ministries,
      flat paintings, controversial novels, Cromwell's spotless integrity, etc.&mdash;why
      not? They interested her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the lady and her family returned to England. Lord Ipsden, who was
      going to Rome, came to England instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not been five days in London, before she made her preparations to
      spend six months in Perthshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought matters to a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden proposed in form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Barbara was surprised; she had not viewed his graceful attentions in
      that light at all. However, she answered by letter his proposal which had
      been made by letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few of those courteous words a lady always bestows on a gentleman
      who has offered her the highest compliment any man has it in his power to
      offer any woman, she came to the point in the following characteristic
      manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man I marry must have two things, virtues and vices&mdash;you have
      neither. You do nothing, and never will do anything but sketch and hum
      tunes, and dance and dangle. Forget this folly the day after to-morrow, my
      dear Ipsden, and, if I may ask a favor of one to whom I refuse that which
      would not be a kindness, be still good friends with her who will always be
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your affectionate <i>Cousin,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "BARBARA SINCLAIR."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this effusion she vanished into Perthshire, leaving her cousin
      stunned by a blow which she thought would be only a scratch to one of his
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden relapsed into greater listlessness than before he had
      cherished these crushed hopes. The world now became really dark and blank
      to him. He was too languid to go anywhere or do anything; a republican
      might have compared the settled expression of his handsome, hopeless face
      with that of most day-laborers of the same age, and moderated his envy of
      the rich and titled.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he became so pale as well as languid that Mr. Saunders interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders was a model valet and factotum; who had been with his master ever
      since he left Eton, and had made himself necessary to him in their
      journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The said Saunders was really an invaluable servant, and, with a world of
      obsequiousness, contrived to have his own way on most occasions. He had, I
      believe, only one great weakness, that of imagining a beau-ideal of
      aristocracy and then outdoing it in the person of John Saunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this Saunders was human, and could not be eight years with this young
      gentleman and not take some little interest in him. He was flunky, and
      took a great interest in him, as stepping-stone to his own greatness. So
      when he saw him turning pale and thin, and reading one letter fifty times,
      he speculated and inquired what was the matter. He brought the intellect
      of Mr. Saunders to bear on the question at the following angle:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, if I was a young lord with 20,000 pounds a year, and all the world
      at my feet, what would make me in this way? Why, the liver! Nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is what is wrong with him, you may depend."
    </p>
    <p>
      This conclusion arrived at, Mr. Saunders coolly wrote his convictions to
      Dr. Aberford, and desired that gentleman's immediate attention to the
      case. An hour or two later, he glided into his lord's room, not without
      some secret trepidation, no trace of which appeared on his face. He pulled
      a long histrionic countenance. "My lord," said he, in soft, melancholy
      tones, "your lordship's melancholy state of health gives me great anxiety;
      and, with many apologies to your lordship, the doctor is sent for, my
      lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Saunders, you are mad; there is nothing the matter with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your lordship's pardon, your lordship is very ill, and Dr. Aberford
      sent for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may go, Saunders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord. I couldn't help it; I've outstepped my duty, my lord, but I
      could not stand quiet and see your lordship dying by inches." Here Mr. S.
      put a cambric handkerchief artistically to his eyes, and glided out,
      having disarmed censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden fell into a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is my mind or my body disordered? Dr. Aberford!&mdash;absurd!&mdash;Saunders
      is getting too pragmatical. The doctor shall prescribe for him instead of
      me; by Jove, that would serve him right." And my lord faintly chuckled.
      "No! this is what I am ill of"&mdash;and he read the fatal note again. "I
      do nothing!&mdash;cruel, unjust," sighed he. "I could have done, would
      have done, anything to please her. Do nothing! nobody does anything now&mdash;things
      don't come in your way to be done as they used centuries ago, or we should
      do them just the same; it is their fault, not ours," argued his lordship,
      somewhat confusedly; then, leaning his brow upon the sofa, he wished to
      die. For, at that dark moment life seemed to this fortunate man an aching
      void; a weary, stale, flat, unprofitable tale; a faded flower; a ball-room
      after daylight has crept in, and music, motion and beauty are fled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Aberford, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      This announcement, made by Mr. Saunders, checked his lordship's reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insults everybody, does he not, Saunders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord," said Saunders, monotonously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he will me; that might amuse me," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the doctor bowled into the apartment, tugging at his
      gloves, as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contrast between him and our poor rich friend is almost beyond human
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here lay on a sofa Ipsden, one of the most distinguished young gentlemen
      in Europe; a creature incapable, by nature, of a rugged tone or a coarse
      gesture; a being without the slightest apparent pretension, but refined
      beyond the wildest dream of dandies. To him, enter Aberford, perspiring
      and shouting. He was one of those globules of human quicksilver one sees
      now and then for two seconds; they are, in fact, two globules; their head
      is one, invariably bald, round, and glittering; the body is another in
      activity and shape, <i>totus teres atque rotundus;</i> and in fifty years
      they live five centuries. <i>Horum Rex Aberford</i>&mdash;of these our
      doctor was the chief. He had hardly torn off one glove, and rolled as far
      as the third flower from the door on his lordship's carpet, before he
      shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my patient, lolloping in pursuit of health. Your hand," added he.
      For he was at the sofa long before his lordship could glide off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tongue. Pulse is good. Breathe in my face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Breathe in your face, sir! how can I do that?" (with an air of mild
      doubt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "By first inhaling, and then exhaling in the direction required, or how
      can I make acquaintance with your bowels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bowels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The abdomen, and the greater and lesser intestines. Well, never mind, I
      can get at them another way; give your heart a slap, so. That's your
      liver. And that's your diaphragm."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship having found the required spot (some people that I know could
      not) and slapped it, the Aberford made a circular spring and listened
      eagerly at his shoulder-blade; the result of this scientific pantomime
      seemed to be satisfactory, for he exclaimed, not to say bawled:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halo! here is a viscount as sound as a roach! Now, young gentleman,"
      added he, "your organs are superb, yet you are really out of sorts; it
      follows you have the maladies of idle minds, love, perhaps, among the
      rest; you blush, a diagnostic of that disorder; make your mind easy,
      cutaneous disorders, such as love, etc., shall never kill a patient of
      mine with a stomach like yours. So, now to cure you!" And away went the
      spherical doctor, with his hands behind him, not up and down the room, but
      slanting and tacking, like a knight on a chess-board. He had not made many
      steps before, turning his upper globule, without affecting his lower, he
      hurled back, in a cold business-like tone, the following interrogatory:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are your vices?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders," inquired the patient, "which are my vices?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'lord, lordship hasn't any vices," replied Saunders, with dull,
      matter-of-fact solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Barbara makes the same complaint," thought Lord Ipsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems I have not any vices, Dr. Aberford," said he, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is bad; nothing to get hold of. What interests you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What amuses you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! no winning horse to gallop away your rents?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No opera girl to run her foot and ankle through your purse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir! and I think their ankles are not what they were."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stuff! just the same, from their ankles up to their ears, and down again
      to their morals; it is your eyes that are sunk deeper into your head. Hum!
      no horses, no vices, no dancers, no yacht; you confound one's notions of
      nobility, and I ought to know them, for I have to patch them all up a bit
      just before they go to the deuce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have, Doctor Aberford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A yacht! and a clipper she is, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!&mdash;(Now I've got him.)"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the Bay of Biscay she lay half a point nearer the wind than Lord
      Heavyjib."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! bother Lord Heavyjib, and his Bay of Biscay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart, they have often bothered me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send her round to Granton Pier, in the Firth of Forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And write down this prescription." And away he walked again, thinking the
      prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders," appealed his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders be hanged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir!" said Saunders, with dignity, "I thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't thank me, thank your own deserts," replied the modern Chesterfield.
      "Oblige me by writing it yourself, my lord, it is all the bodily exercise
      you will have had to-day, no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young viscount bowed, seated himself at a desk, and wrote from
      dictation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DR. ABERFORD'S PRESCRIPTION."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make acquaintance with all the people of low estate who have time to be
      bothered with you; learn their ways, their minds, and, above all, their
      troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't all this bore me?" suggested the writer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see. Relieve one fellow-creature every day, and let Mr. Saunders
      book the circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall like this part," said the patient, laying down his pen. "How
      clever of you to think of such things; may not I do two sometimes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not; one pill per day. Write, Fish the herring! (that beats
      deer-stalking.) Run your nose into adventures at sea; live on tenpence,
      and earn it. Is it down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is down, but Saunders would have written it better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he hadn't he ought to be hanged," said the Aberford, inspecting the
      work. "I'm off, where's my hat? oh, there; where's my money? oh, here. Now
      look here, follow my prescription, and You will soon have Mens sana in
      corpore sano; And not care whether the girls say yes or say no; neglect
      it, and&mdash;my gloves; oh, in my pocket&mdash;you will be <i>blase'</i>
      and <i>ennuye',</i> and (an English participle, that means something as
      bad); God bless you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And out he scuttled, glided after by Saunders, for whom he opened and shut
      the street door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was a greater effect produced by a doctor's visit; patient and
      physician were made for each other. Dr. Aberford was the specific for Lord
      Ipsden. He came to him like a shower to a fainting strawberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders, on his return, found his lord pacing the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders," said he, smartly, "send down to Gravesend and order the yacht
      to this place&mdash;what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granton Pier. Yes, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, Saunders, take clothes, and books, and violins, and telescopes, and
      things&mdash;and me&mdash;to Euston Square, in an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible,' my lord," cried Saunders, in dismay. "And there is no train
      for hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      His master replied with a hundred-pound note, and a quiet, but wickedish
      look; and the prince of gentlemen's gentleman had all the required items
      with him, in a special train, within the specified time, and away they
      flashed, northward.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT is said that opposite characters make a union happiest; and perhaps
      Lord Ipsden, diffident of himself, felt the value to him of a creature so
      different as Lady Barbara Sinclair; but the lady, for her part, was not so
      diffident of herself, nor was she in search of her opposite. On the
      contrary, she was waiting patiently to find just such a man as she was, or
      fancied herself, a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to measure men by their characters alone, and to treat with
      sublime contempt the accidents of birth and fortune, she had been a little
      staggered by the assurance of this butterfly that had proposed to settle
      upon her hand&mdash;for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a word, the beautiful writer of the fatal note was honestly romantic,
      according to the romance of 1848, and of good society; of course she was
      not affected by hair tumbling back or plastered down forward, and a
      rolling eye went no further with her than a squinting one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her romance was stern, not sickly. She was on the lookout for iron
      virtues; she had sworn to be wooed with great deeds, or never won; on this
      subject she had thought much, though not enough to ask herself whether
      great deeds are always to be got at, however disposed a lover may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter; she kept herself in reserve for some earnest man, who was not
      to come flattering and fooling to her, but look another way and do
      exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      She liked Lord Ipsden, her cousin once removed, but despised him for being
      agreeable, handsome, clever, and nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was also a little bitten with what she and others called the Middle
      Ages, in fact with that picture of them which Grub Street, imposing on the
      simplicity of youth, had got up for sale by arraying painted glass, gilt
      rags, and fancy, against fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these vague and sketchy notices we are compelled to part, for the
      present, with Lady Barbara. But it serves her right; she has gone to
      establish her court in Perthshire, and left her rejected lover on our
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Journeys of a few hundred miles are no longer described.
    </p>
    <p>
      You exchange a dead chair for a living chair, Saunders puts in your hand a
      new tale like this; you mourn the superstition of booksellers, which still
      inflicts uncut leaves upon humanity, though tailors do not send home coats
      with the sleeves stitched up, nor chambermaids put travelers into
      apple-pie beds as well as damp sheets. You rend and read, and are at
      Edinburgh, fatigued more or less, but not by the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden was, therefore, soon installed by the Firth side, full of the
      Aberford.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young nobleman not only venerated the doctor's sagacity, but half
      admired his brusquerie and bustle; things of which he was himself never
      guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the prescription, that was a Delphic Oracle. Worlds could not have
      tempted him to deviate from a letter in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited with impatience for the yacht; and, meantime, it struck him that
      the first part of the prescription could be attacked at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the afternoon of the day succeeding his arrival. The Fifeshire
      hills, seen across the Firth from his windows, were beginning to take
      their charming violet tinge, a light breeze ruffled the blue water into a
      sparkling smile, the shore was tranquil, and the sea full of noiseless
      life, with the craft of all sizes gliding and dancing and courtesying on
      their trackless roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was tepid, pure and sweet as heaven; this bright afternoon, Nature
      had grudged nothing that could give fresh life and hope to such dwellers
      in dust and smoke and vice as were there to look awhile on her clean face
      and drink her honeyed breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young gentleman was not insensible to the beauty of the scene. He was
      a little lazy by nature, and made lazier by the misfortune of wealth, but
      he had sensibilities; he was an artist of great natural talent; had he
      only been without a penny, how he would have handled the brush! And then
      he was a mighty sailor; if he had sailed for biscuit a few years, how he
      would have handled a ship!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was, he had the eye of a hawk for Nature's beauties, and the sea
      always came back to him like a friend after an absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scene, then, curled round his heart a little, and he felt the good
      physician was wiser than the tribe that go by that name, and strive to
      build health on the sandy foundation of drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders! do you know what Dr. Aberford means by the lower classes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are there any about here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to say they are everywhere, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get me some"&mdash;<i>(cigarette).</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Out went Saunders, with his usual graceful <i>empressement,</i> but an
      internal shrug of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was absent an hour and a half; he then returned with a double
      expression on his face&mdash;pride at his success in diving to the very
      bottom of society, and contempt of what he had fished up thence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached his lord mysteriously, and said, <i>sotto voce,</i> but
      impressively, "This is low enough, my lord." Then glided back, and ushered
      in, with polite disdain, two lovelier women than he had ever opened a door
      to in the whole course of his perfumed existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their heads they wore caps of Dutch or Flemish origin, with a broad
      lace border, stiffened and arched over the forehead, about three inches
      high, leaving the brow and cheeks unencumbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had cotton jackets, bright red and yellow, mixed in patterns,
      confined at the waist by the apron-strings, but bobtailed below the waist;
      short woolen petticoats, with broad vertical stripes, red and white, most
      vivid in color; white worsted stockings, and neat, though high-quartered
      shoes. Under their jackets they wore a thick spotted cotton handkerchief,
      about one inch of which was visible round the lower part of the throat. Of
      their petticoats, the outer one was kilted, or gathered up toward the
      front, and the second, of the same color, hung in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these young women, one had an olive complexion, with the red blood
      mantling under it, and black hair, and glorious black eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was fair, with a massive but shapely throat, as white as milk;
      glossy brown hair, the loose threads of which glittered like gold, and a
      blue eye, which, being contrasted with dark eyebrows and lashes, took the
      luminous effect peculiar to that rare beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their short petticoats revealed a neat ankle, and a leg with a noble
      swell; for Nature, when she is in earnest, builds beauty on the ideas of
      ancient sculptors and poets, not of modern poetasters, who, with their
      airy-like sylphs and their smoke-like verses, fight for want of flesh in
      woman and want of fact in poetry as parallel beauties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>They are,</i> my lads.&mdash;<i>Continuez!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      These women had a grand corporeal trait; they had never known a corset! so
      they were straight as javelins; they could lift their hands above their
      heads!&mdash;actually! Their supple persons moved as Nature intended;
      every gesture was ease, grace and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with their own radiance, and the snowy cleanliness and brightness of
      their costume, they came like meteors into the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden, rising gently from his seat, with the same quiet politeness
      with which he would have received two princes of the blood, said, "How do
      you do?" and smiled a welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine! hoow's yoursel?" answered the dark lass, whose name was Jean
      Carnie, and whose voice was not so sweet as her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'n lord are ye?" continued she; "are you a juke? I wad like fine to
      hae a crack wi' a juke."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders, who knew himself the cause of this question, replied, <i>sotto
      voce,</i> "His lordship is a viscount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didna ken't," was Jean's remark. "But it has a bonny soond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What mair would ye hae?" said the fair beauty, whose name was Christie
      Johnstone. Then, appealing to his lordship as the likeliest to know, she
      added, "Nobeelity is jist a soond itsel, I'm tauld."
    </p>
    <p>
      The viscount, finding himself expected to say something on a topic he had
      not attended much to, answered dryly: "We must ask the republicans, they
      are the people that give their minds to such subjects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yon man," asked Jean Carnie, "is he a lord, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am his lordship's servant," replied Saunders, gravely, not without a
      secret misgiving whether fate had been just.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na!" replied she, not to be imposed upon, "ye are statelier and prooder
      than this ane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will explain," said his master. "Saunders knows his value; a servant
      like Saunders is rarer than an idle viscount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, my lord!" remonstrated Saunders, with a shocked and most
      disclamatory tone. "Rather!" was his inward reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jean," said Christie, "ye hae muckle to laern. Are ye for herrin' the
      day, vile count?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! are you for this sort of thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Saunders, with a world of <i>empressement,</i> offered the Carnie
      some cake that was on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a piece, instantly spat it out into her hand, and with more
      energy than delicacy flung it into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Augh!" cried she, "just a sugar and saut butter thegither; buy nae mair
      at yon shoep, vile count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try this, out of Nature's shop," laughed their entertainer; and he
      offered them, himself, some peaches and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! a medi&mdash;cine!" said Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nature, my lad," said Miss Carnie, making her ivory teeth meet in their
      first nectarine, "I didna ken whaur ye stoep, but ye beat the other
      confectioners, that div ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair lass, who had watched the viscount all this time as demurely as a
      cat cream, now approached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young woman was the thinker; her voice was also rich, full, and
      melodious, and her manner very engaging; it was half advancing, half
      retiring, not easy to resist or to describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noo," said she, with a very slight blush stealing across her face, "ye
      maun let me catecheeze ye, wull ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The last two words were said in a way that would have induced a bear to
      reveal his winter residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled assent. Saunders retired to the door, and, excluding every shade
      of curiosity from his face, took an attitude, half majesty, half
      obsequiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie stood by Lord Ipsden, with one hand on her hip (the knuckles
      downward), but graceful as Antinous, and began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoo muckle is the queen greater than y' are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship was obliged to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see&mdash;as is the moon to a wax taper, so is her majesty the
      queen to you and me, and the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' whaur does the Juke* come in?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Buceleuch.
</pre>
    <p>
      "On this particular occasion, the Duke** makes one of us, my pretty maid."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     **Wellington
</pre>
    <p>
      "I see! Are na yeawfu' prood o' being a lorrd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an idea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His lordship did not go to bed a spinning-jenny, and rise up a lord, like
      some of them," put in Saunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders," said the peer, doubtfully, "eloquence rather bores people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I mustn't speak again, my lord," said Saunders, respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noo," said the fair inquisitor, "ye shall tell me how ye came to be
      lorrds, your faemily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na! ye manna flee to Sandy for a thing, ye are no a bairn, are ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a dilemma, the Saunders prop knocked rudely away, and obliged to
      think for ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Saunders would come to his distressed master's assistance. He
      furtively conveyed to him a plump book&mdash;this was Saunders's manual of
      faith; the author was Mr. Burke, not Edmund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden ran hastily over the page, closed the book, and said, "Here is
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five hundred years ago&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Jean," said Christie; "we're gaun to get a boeny story. 'Five
      hundre' years ago,'" added she, with interest and awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was a great battle," resumed the narrator, in cheerful tones, as one
      larking with history, "between a king of England and his rebels. He was in
      the thick of the fight&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the king, Jean, he was in the thick o't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My ancestor killed a fellow who was sneaking behind him, but the next
      moment a man-at-arms prepared a thrust at his majesty, who had his hands
      full with three assailants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! that's no fair," said Christie, "as sure as deeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My ancestor dashed forward, and, as the king's sword passed through one
      of them, he clove another to the waist with a blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weel done! weel done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden looked at the speaker, her eyes were glittering, and her cheek
      flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" thought he; "she believes it!" So he began to take more
      pains with his legend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But for the spearsman," continued he, "he had nothing but his body; he
      gave it, it was his duty, and received the death leveled at his
      sovereign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! puir mon." And the glowing eyes began to glisten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The battle flowed another way, and God gave victory to the right; but the
      king came back to look for him, for it was no common service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deed no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Lord Ipsden began to turn his eye inward, and call up the scene. He
      lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They found him lying on his back, looking death in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nobles, by the king's side, uncovered as soon as he was found, for
      they were brave men, too. There was a moment's silence; eyes met eyes, and
      said, this is a stout soldier's last battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king could not bid him live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na! lad, King Deeth has ower strong a grrip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he did what kings can do, he gave him two blows with his royal
      sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the robber, and him a deeing mon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two words from his royal mouth, and he and we were Barons of Ipsden and
      Hawthorn Glen from that day to this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the puir dying creature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What poor dying creature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your forbear, lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why you call him poor, madam; all the men of that day are
      dust; they are the gold dust who died with honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He looked round, uneasily, for his son&mdash;for he had but one&mdash;and
      when that son knelt, unwounded, by him, he said, 'Goodnight, Baron
      Ipsden;' and so he died, fire in his eye, a smile on his lip, and honor on
      his name forever. I meant to tell you a lie, and I've told you the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laddie," said Christie, half admiringly, half reproachfully, "ye gar the
      tear come in my een. Hech! look at yon lassie! how could you think t'eat
      plums through siccan a bonny story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hets," answered Jean, who had, in fact, cleared the plate, "I aye listen
      best when my ain mooth's stappit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But see, now," pondered Christie, "twa words fra a king&mdash;thir titles
      are just breeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," was the answer. "All titles are. What is popularity? ask
      Aristides and Lamartine&mdash;the breath of a mob&mdash;smells of its
      source&mdash;and is gone before the sun can set on it. Now the royal
      breath does smell of the Rose and Crown, and stays by us from age to age."
    </p>
    <p>
      The story had warmed our marble acquaintance. Saunders opened his eyes,
      and thought, "We shall wake up the House of Lords some evening&mdash;<i>we</i>
      shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship then added, less warmly, looking at the girls:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I should like to be a fisherman."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, my lord yawned slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this aspiration the young fishwives deigned no attention, doubting,
      perhaps, its sincerity; and Christie, with a shade of severity, inquired
      of him how he came to be a vile count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A baron's no' a vile count, I'm sure," said she; "sae tell me how ye came
      to be a vile count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said he, "that is by no means a pretty story like the other; you
      will not like it, I am sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, will I&mdash;ay, will I; I'm aye seeking knoewledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is soon told. One of us sat twenty years on one seat, in the
      same house, so one day he got up a&mdash;viscount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ower muckle pay for ower little wark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now don't say that; I wouldn't do it to be Emperor of Russia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel, I hae gotten a heap out o' ye; sae noow I'll gang, since ye are no
      for herrin'; come away, Jean."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this their host remonstrated, and inquired why bores are at one's
      service night and day, and bright people are always in a hurry; he was
      informed in reply, "Labor is the lot o' man. Div ye no ken that muckle?
      And abune a' o' women."*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A local idea, I suspect.&mdash;C. R.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Why, what can two such pretty creatures have to do except to be admired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This question coming within the dark beauty's scope, she hastened to
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To sell our herrin'&mdash;we hae three hundre' left in the creel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the price?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this question the poetry died out of Christie Johnstone's face, she
      gave her companion a rapid look, indiscernible by male eye, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three a penny, sirr; they are no plenty the day," added she, in smooth
      tones that carried conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Little liar; they were selling six a penny everywhere.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders, buy them all, and be ever so long about it; count them, or some
      nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's daft! he's daft! Oh, ye ken, Jean, an Ennglishman and a lorrd, twa
      daft things thegither, he could na' miss the road. Coont them, lassie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come away, Sandy, till I count them till ye," said Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders and Jean disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business being out of sight, curiosity revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' what brings ye here from London, if ye please?" recommenced the fair
      inquisitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a good countenance; there is something in your face. I could
      find it in my heart to tell you, but I should bore you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "De'el a fear! Bore me, bore me! wheat's thaat, I wonder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name, madam? Mine is Ipsden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They ca' me Christie Johnstone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Christie Johnstone, I am under the doctor's hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Puir lad. What's the trouble?" (solemnly and tenderly.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ennui!" (rather piteously.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yawn-we? I never heerd tell o't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you lucky girl," burst out he; "but the doctor has undertaken to cure
      me; in one thing you could assist me, if I am not presuming too far on our
      short acquaintance. I am to relieve one poor distressed person every day,
      but I mustn't do two. Is not that a bore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gie's your hand, gie's your hand. I'm vexed for ca'ing you daft. Hech!
      what a saft hand ye hae. Jean, I'm saying, come here, feel this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, who had run in, took the viscount's hand from Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It never wroucht any," explained Jean. "And he has bonny hair," said
      Christie, just touching his locks on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a bonny lad," said Jean, inspecting him scientifically, and
      pointblank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, is he," said the other. "Aweel, there's Jess Rutherford, a widdy, wi'
      four bairns, ye meicht do waur than ware your siller on her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five pounds to begin?" inquired his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five pund! Are ye made o' siller? Ten schell'n!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders was rung for, and produced a one-pound note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The herrin' is five and saxpence; it's four and saxpence I'm awin ye,"
      said the young fishwife, "and Jess will be a glad woman the neicht."
    </p>
    <p>
      The settlement was effected, and away went the two friends, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-boye, vile count."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their host fell into thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When have I talked so much?" asked he of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Aberford, you are a wonderful man; I like your lower classes
      amazingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me'fiez vous, Monsieur Ipsden!" should some mentor have said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Devil puts into a beginner's hands ace, queen, five trumps, to give
      him a taste for whist, so these lower classes have perhaps put forward one
      of their best cards to lead you into a false estimate of the strength of
      their hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, however, of this, who should return, to disturb the equilibrium
      of truth, but this Christina Johnstone? She came thoughtfully in, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been taking a thoucht, and this is no what yon gude physeecian
      meaned; ye are no to fling your chaerity like a bane till a doeg; ye'll
      gang yoursel to Jess Rutherford; Flucker Johnstone, that's my brother,
      will convoy ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how is your brother to know me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? Because I'll gie him a sair sair hiding, if he lets ye gang by."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she returned the one-pound note, a fresh settlement was effected, and
      she left him. At the door she said: "And I am muckle obleeged to ye for
      your story and your goodness."
    </p>
    <p>
      While uttering these words, she half kissed her hand to him, with a lofty
      and disengaged gesture, such as one might expect from a queen, if queens
      did not wear stays; and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his lordship, a few minutes after, sauntered out for a stroll, the
      first object he beheld was an exact human square, a handsome boy, with a
      body swelled out apparently to the size of a man's, with blue flannel, and
      blue cloth above it, leaning against a wall, with his hands in his pockets&mdash;a
      statuette of <i>insouciance.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This marine puff-ball was Flucker Johnstone, aged fourteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stain his sister's face with diluted walnut-juice, as they make the stage
      gypsy and Red Indian (two animals imagined by actors to be one), and you
      have Flucker's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight moral distinction remains, not to be so easily got over.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the best girl in the place, and he a baddish boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, as sharp in his way as she was intelligent in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This youthful mariner allowed his lordship to pass him, and take twenty
      steps, but watched him all the time, and compared him with a description
      furnished him by his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then followed, and brought him to, as he called it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I daur say it's you I'm to convoy to yon auld faggitt!" said this baddish
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went, Flucker rolling and pitching and yawing to keep up with the
      lordly galley, for a fisherman's natural waddle is two miles an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very entrance of Newhaven, the new pilot suddenly sung out,
      "Starboard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Starboard it was, and they ascended a filthy "close," or alley they
      mounted a staircase which was out of doors, and, without knocking, Flucker
      introduced himself into Jess Rutherford's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here a gentleman to speak till ye, wife."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE widow was weather-beaten and rough. She sat mending an old net.
    </h3>
    <p>
      "The gentleman's welcome," said she; but there was no gratification in her
      tone, and but little surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship then explained that, understanding there were worthy people
      in distress, he was in hopes he might be permitted to assist them, and
      that she must blame a neighbor of hers if he had broken in upon her too
      abruptly with this object. He then, with a blush, hinted at ten shillings,
      which he begged she would consider as merely an installment, until he
      could learn the precise nature of her embarrassments, and the best way of
      placing means at her disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The widow heard all this with a lackluster mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years her life had been unsuccessful labor; if anything had ever
      come to her, it had always been a misfortune; her incidents had been
      thorns&mdash;her events, daggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not realize a human angel coming to her relief, and she did not
      realize it, and she worked away at her net.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, Flucker, to whom his lordship's speech appeared monstrously weak
      and pointless, drew nigh, and gave the widow, in her ear, his version,
      namely, his sister's embellished. It was briefly this: That the gentleman
      was a daft lord from England, who had come with the bank in his breeks, to
      remove poverty from Scotland, beginning with her. "Sae speak loud aneuch,
      and ye'll no want siller," was his polite corollary.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship rose, laid a card on a chair, begged her to make use of him,
      et cetera; he then, recalling the oracular prescription, said, "Do me the
      favor to apply to me for any little sum you have a use for, and, in
      return, I will beg of you (if it does not bore you too much) to make me
      acquainted with any little troubles you may have encountered in the course
      of your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, receiving no answer, was about to go, after bowing to her,
      and smiling gracefully upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand was on the latch, when Jess Rutherford burst into a passion of
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My <i>troubles,</i> laddie," cried she, trembling all over. "The sun wad
      set, and rise, and set again, ere I could tell ye a' the trouble I hae
      come through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ye need na vex yourself for an auld wife's tears; tears are a
      blessin', lad, I shall assure ye. Mony's the time I hae prayed for them,
      and could na hae them Sit ye doon! sit ye doon! I'll no let ye gang fra my
      door till I hae thankit ye&mdash;but gie me time, gie me time. I canna
      greet a' the days of the week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker, <i>aetat.</i> 14, opened his eyes, unable to connect ten
      shillings and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden sat down, and felt very sorry for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she cried at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one touch of nature make the whole world kin, methinks that sweet and
      wonderful thing, sympathy, is not less powerful. What frozen barriers,
      what ice of centuries, it can melt in a moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      His bare mention of her troubles had surprised the widowed woman's heart,
      and now she looked up and examined his countenance; it was soon done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman, young or old, high or low, can discern and appreciate sensibility
      in a man's face, at a single glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she saw there was enough. She was sure of sympathy. She recalled her
      resolve, and the tale of her sorrows burst from her like a flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old fishwife told the young aristocrat how she had borne twelve
      children, and buried six as bairns; how her man was always unlucky; how a
      mast fell on him, and disabled him a whole season; how they could but just
      keep the pot boiling by the deep-sea fishing, and he was not allowed to
      dredge for oysters, because his father was not a Newhaven man. How, when
      the herring fishing came, to make all right, he never had another man's
      luck; how his boat's crew would draw empty nets, and a boat alongside him
      would be gunwale down in the water with the fish. How, at last, one
      morning, the 20th day of November, his boat came in to Newhaven Pier
      without him, and when he was inquired for, his crew said, "He had stayed
      at home, like a lazy loon, and not sailed with them the night before." How
      she was anxious, and had all the public houses searched. "For he took a
      drop now and then, nae wonder, and him aye in the weather." Poor thing!
      when he was alive she used to call him a drunken scoundrel to his face.
      How, when the tide went down, a mad wife, whose husband had been drowned
      twenty years ago, pointed out something under the pier that the rest took
      for sea-weed floating&mdash;how it was the hair of her man's head, washed
      about by the water, and he was there, drowned without a cry or a struggle,
      by his enormous boots, that kept him in an upright position, though he was
      dead; there he stood&mdash;dead&mdash;drowned by slipping from the
      slippery pier, close to his comrades' hands, in a dark and gusty night;
      how her daughter married, and was well to do, and assisted her; how she
      fell into a rapid decline, and died, a picture of health to inexperienced
      eyes. How she, the mother, saw and knew, and watched the treacherous
      advance of disease and death; how others said gayly, "Her daughter was
      better," and she was obliged to say, "Yes." How she had worked, eighteen
      hours a day, at making nets; how, when she let out her nets to the other
      men at the herring fishing, they always cheated her, because her man was
      gone. How she had many times had to choose between begging her meal and
      going to bed without it, but, thank Heaven! she had always chosen the
      latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him of hunger, cold, and anguish. As she spoke they became real
      things to him; up to that moment they had been things in a story-book. And
      as she spoke she rocked herself from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, she was a woman "acquainted with grief." She might have said,
      "Here I and sorrow sit. This is my throne, bid kings come and bow to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hearer felt this, and therefore this woman, poor, old, and ugly,
      became sacred in his eye; it was with a strange sort of respect that he
      tried to console her. He spoke to her in tones gentle and sweet as the
      south wind on a summer evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said he, "let me be so happy as to bring you some comfort. The
      sorrows of the heart I cannot heal; they are for a mightier hand; but a
      part of your distress appears to have been positive need; that we can at
      least dispose of, and I entreat you to believe that from this hour want
      shall never enter that door again. Never! upon my honor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotch are icebergs, with volcanoes underneath; thaw the Scotch ice,
      which is very cold, and you shall get to the Scotch fire, warmer than any
      sun of Italy or Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship had risen to go. The old wife had seemed absorbed in her own
      grief; she now dried her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bide ye, sirr," said she, "till I thank ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she began to thank him, rather coldly and stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says ye are a lord," said she; "I dinna ken, an' I dinna care; but
      ye're a gentleman, I daur say, and a kind heart ye hae."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And ye'll never be a grain the poorer for the siller ye hae gien me; for
      he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's no your siller; dinna think it&mdash;na, lad, na! Oh, fine! I
      ken there's mony a supper for the bairns and me in yon bits metal; but I
      canna feel your siller as I feel your winsome smile&mdash;the drop in your
      young een&mdash;an' the sweet words ye gied me, in the sweet music o' your
      Soothern tongue, Gude bless ye!" (Where was her ice by this time?) "Gude
      bless ye! and I bless ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she did bless him; and what a blessing it was; not a melodious
      generality, like a stage parent's, or papa's in a damsel's novel. It was
      like the son of Barak on Zophim.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blessed him, as one who had the power and the right to bless or curse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood on the high ground of her low estate, and her afflictions&mdash;and
      demanded of their Creator to bless the fellow-creature that had come to
      her aid and consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman had suffered to the limits of endurance; yesterday she had
      said, "Surely the Almighty does na <i>see</i> me a' these years!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So now she blessed him, and her heart's blood seemed to gush into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She blessed him by land and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew most mortal griefs; for she had felt them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She warned them away from him one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the joys of life; for she had felt their want.
    </p>
    <p>
      She summoned them one by one to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a fair wind to your ship," cried she, "and the storms aye ten miles
      to leeward o' her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many happy days, "an' weel spent," she wished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His love should love him dearly, or a better take her place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Health to his side by day; sleep to his pillow by night."
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand good wishes came, like a torrent of fire, from her lips, with a
      power that eclipsed his dreams of human eloquence; and then, changing in a
      moment from the thunder of a Pythoness to the tender music of some poetess
      mother, she ended:
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' oh, my boenny, boenny lad, may ye be wi' the rich upon the airth a'
      your days&mdash;AND WI' THE PUIR IN THE WARLD TO COME!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship's tongue refused him the thin phrases of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell for the present," said he, and he went quietly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paced thoughtfully home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had drunk a fact with every sentence; and an idea with every fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the knowledge we have never realized is not knowledge to us&mdash;only
      knowledge's shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the banished duke, he now began to feel, "we are not alone unhappy."
      This universal world contains other guess sorrows than yours, viscount&mdash;<i>scilicet</i>
      than unvarying health, unbroken leisure, and incalculable income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then this woman's eloquence! bless me! he had seen folk murmur politely in
      the Upper House, and drone or hammer away at the Speaker down below, with
      more heat than warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had seen nine hundred wild beasts fed with peppered tongue, in a
      menagerie called <i>L'Assemble' Nationale.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      His ears had rung often enough, for that matter. This time his heart beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been in the principal courts of Europe; knew what a handful of
      gentlefolks call "the World"; had experienced the honeyed words of
      courtiers, the misty nothings of diplomatists, and the innocent prattle of
      mighty kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hitherto he seemed to have undergone gibberish and jargon:
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibberish and jargon&mdash;Political!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibberish and jargon&mdash;Social!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibberish and jargon&mdash;Theological!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibberish and jargon&mdash;Positive!
    </p>
    <p>
      People had been prating&mdash;Jess had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, it is to be observed, he was under the double effect of eloquence and
      novelty; and, so situated, we overrate things, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he made a provision for this poor woman, in case he should die
      before next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows?" said he, "she is such an unlucky woman." Then he went to bed,
      and whether from the widow's blessing, or the air of the place, he slept
      like a plowboy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Richard, Lord Ipsden, to work out the Aberford problem&mdash;to
      relieve poor people, one or two of whom, like the Rutherford, were
      grateful, the rest acted it to the life&mdash;to receive now and then a
      visit from Christina Johnstone, who borrowed every mortal book in his
      house, who sold him fish, invariably cheated him by the indelible force of
      habit, and then remorsefully undid the bargain, with a peevish entreaty
      that "he would not be so green, for there was no doing business with him"&mdash;to
      be fastened upon by Flucker, who, with admirable smoothness and cunning,
      wormed himself into a cabin-boy on board the yacht, and man-at-arms
      ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cruise in search of adventures, and meet nothing but disappointments;
      to acquire a browner tint, a lighter step, and a jacket, our story moves
      for a while toward humbler personages.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      JESS RUTHERFORD, widow of Alexander Johnstone&mdash;for Newhaven wives,
      like great artists, change their conditions without changing their names&mdash;was
      known in the town only as a dour wife, a sour old carline. Whose fault?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do wooden faces and iron tongues tempt sorrow to put out its snails'
      horns?
    </p>
    <p>
      She hardly spoke to any one, or any one to her, but four days after the
      visit we have described people began to bend looks of sympathy on her, to
      step out of their way to give her a kindly good-morrow; after a bit, fish
      and meal used to be placed on her table by one neighbor or another, when
      she was out, and so on. She was at first behindhand in responding to all
      this, but by degrees she thawed to those who were thawing to her. Next,
      Saunders called on her, and showed her a settlement, made for her benefit,
      on certain lands in Lanarkshire. She was at ease for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Almighty had seen her all these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how came her neighbors to melt?
    </p>
    <p>
      Because a nobleman had visited her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not exactly, dear novel-reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night, by a bright fire lighting up snowy walls, burnished
      copper, gleaming candlesticks, and a dinner-table floor, sat the mistress
      of the house, Christie Johnstone, and her brother, Flucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      She with a book, he with his reflections opposite her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lassie, hae ye ony siller past ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, lad; an' I mean to keep it!" The baddish boy had registered a vow to
      the contrary, and proceeded to bleed his flint (for to do Christie justice
      the process was not very dissimilar). Flucker had a versatile genius for
      making money; he had made it in forty different ways, by land and sea,
      tenpence at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hae gotten the life o' Jess Rutherford till ye," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Giest then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm seeking half a crown for 't," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, he knew he should never get half a crown, but he also knew that if he
      asked a shilling, he should be beaten down to fourpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      So half a crown was his first bode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy, with anger at her heart, called up a humorous smile, and
      saying, "An' ye'll get saxpence," went about some household matter; in
      reality, to let her proposal rankle in Flucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker lighted his pipe slowly, as one who would not do a sister the
      injustice to notice so trivial a proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited fresh overtures.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie resumed her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the baddish boy fixed his eye on the fire, and said softly and
      thoughtfully to the fire, "Hech, what a heap o' troubles yon woman has
      come through."
    </p>
    <p>
      This stroke of art was not lost. Christie looked up from her book;
      pretended he had spoken to her, gave a fictitious yawn, and renewed the
      negotiation with the air of one disposed to kill time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dying for the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commerce was twice broken off and renewed by each power in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the bargain was struck at fourteen-pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Flucker came out, the honest merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had listened intently, with mercantile views.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the widow's sorrows all off pat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a bit affected himself, but by pure memory he remembered where
      she had been most agitated or overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave it Christie, word for word, and even threw in what dramatists call
      "the business," thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here ye suld greet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here ye'll play your hand like a geraffe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Geraffe? That's a beast, I'm thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na; it's the thing on the hill that makes signals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Telegraph, ye fulish goloshen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo ay, telegraph! Geraffe 's sunest said for a'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Jess Rutherford's life came into Christie Johnstone's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told it to a knot of natives next day; it lost nothing, for she was a
      woman of feeling, and by intuition an artist of the tongue. She was the
      best <i>raconteur</i> in a place where there are a hundred, male and
      female, who attempt that art.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day she told it again, and then inferior narrators got hold of
      it, and it soon circulated through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the cause of the sudden sympathy with Jess Rutherford.
    </p>
    <p>
      As our prigs would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Art had adopted her cause and adorned her tale."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE fishing village of Newhaven is an unique place; it is a colony that
      retains distinct features; the people seldom intermarry with their Scotch
      neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some say the colony is Dutch, some Danish, some Flemish. The character and
      cleanliness of their female costume points rather to the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish, like horse-flesh, corrupts the mind and manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a certain age, the Newhaven fishwife is always a blackguard, and
      ugly; but among the younger specimens, who have not traded too much, or
      come into much contact with larger towns, a charming modesty, or else
      slyness (such as no man can distinguish from it, so it answers every
      purpose), is to be found, combined with rare grace and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a race of women that the northern sun peachifies instead of
      rosewoodizing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sundays the majority sacrifice appearance to fashion; these turn out
      rainbows of silk, satin and lace. In the week they were all grace, and no
      stays; now they seem all stays and no grace. They never look so ill as
      when they change their "costume" for "dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men are smart fishermen, distinguished from the other fishermen of the
      Firth chiefly by their "dredging song."
    </p>
    <p>
      This old song is money to them; thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dredging is practically very stiff rowing for ten hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now both the Newhaven men and their rivals are agreed that this song lifts
      them through more work than untuned fishermen can manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard the song, and seen the work done to it; and incline to think
      it helps the oar, not only by keeping the time true, and the spirit alive,
      but also by its favorable action on the lungs. It is sung in a peculiar
      way; the sound is, as it were, expelled from the chest in a sort of
      musical ejaculations; and the like, we know, was done by the ancient
      gymnasts; and is done by the French bakers, in lifting their enormous
      dough, and by our paviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song, in itself, does not contain above seventy stock verses, but
      these perennial lines are a nucleus, round which the men improvise the
      topics of the day, giving, I know not for what reason, the preference to
      such as verge upon indelicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men and women are musical and narrative; three out of four can sing a
      song or tell a story, and they omit few opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Males and females suck whisky like milk, and are quarrelsome in
      proportion. The men fight (round-handed), the women fleicht or scold, in
      the form of a teapot&mdash;the handle fixed and the spout sawing the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      A singular custom prevails here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maidens have only one sweetheart apiece!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the whole town is in pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courting is all done on Saturday night, by the lady's fire. It is hard
      to keep out of a groove in which all the town is running; and the
      Johnstone had possessed, as mere property&mdash;a lad!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so wealthy that few of them could pretend to aspire to her, so she
      selected for her chattel a young man called Willy Liston; a youth of an
      unhappy turn&mdash;he contributed nothing to hilarity, his face was a
      kill-joy&mdash;nobody liked him; for this female reason Christie
      distinguished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a divine supper every Saturday night in her house; he ate, and
      sighed! Christie fed him, and laughed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker ditto.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she neither fed nor laughed at any other man, some twenty were bitterly
      jealous of Willy Liston, and this gave the blighted youth a cheerful
      moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bright alliance received a check some months before our tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie was <i>heluo librorum!</i> and like others who have that taste,
      and can only gratify it in the interval of manual exercise, she read very
      intensely in her hours of study. A book absorbed her. She was like a leech
      on these occasions, <i>non missura cutem.</i> Even Jean Carnie, her
      co-adjutor or "neebor," as they call it, found it best to keep out of her
      way till the book was sucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Saturday night Willy Liston's evil star ordained that a gentleman of
      French origin and Spanish dress, called Gil Blas, should be the
      Johnstone's companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willy Liston arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie, who had bolted the door, told him from the window, civilly
      enough, but decidedly, "She would excuse his company that night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vara weel," said Willy, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Saturday&mdash;no Willy came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ditto the next. Willy was waiting the <i>amende.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie forgot to make it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she was passing the boats, Willy beckoned her mysteriously; he led
      her to his boat, which was called "The Christie Johnstone"; by the boat's
      side was a paint pot and brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not supped together for five Saturdays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ergo, Mr. Liston had painted out the first four letters of "Christie," he
      now proceeded to paint out the fifth, giving her to understand, that, if
      she allowed the whole name to go, a letter every blank Saturday, her image
      would be gradually, but effectually, obliterated from the heart Listonian.
    </p>
    <p>
      My reader has done what Liston did not, anticipate her answer. She
      recommended him, while his hand was in, to paint out the entire name, and,
      with white paint and a smaller brush, to substitute some other female
      appellation. So saying, she tripped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Liston on this was guilty of the following inconsistency; he pressed
      the paint carefully out of the brush into the pot. Having thus economized
      his material, he hurled the pot which contained his economy at "the
      Johnstone," he then adjourned to the "Peacock," and "away at once with
      love and reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth, when men asked who was Christie Johnstone's lad, the answer
      used to be, "She's seeking ane." <i>Quelle horreur!!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Newhaven doesn't know everything, but my intelligent reader suspects, and,
      if confirming his suspicions can reconcile him to our facts, it will soon
      be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he must come with us to Edinburgh; it's only three miles.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A LITTLE band of painters came into Edinburgh from a professional walk.
      Three were of Edinburgh&mdash;Groove, aged fifty; Jones and Hyacinth,
      young; the latter long-haired.
    </p>
    <p>
      With them was a young Englishman, the leader of the expedition, Charles
      Gatty.
    </p>
    <p>
      His step was elastic, and his manner wonderfully animated, without
      loudness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bright day," said he. "The sun forgot where he was, and shone;
      everything was in favor of art."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, no," replied old Groove, "not where I was"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what was the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The flies kept buzzing and biting, and sticking in the work. That's the
      worst of out o' doors!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The flies! is that all? Swear the spiders in special constables next
      time," cried Gatty. "We shall win the day;" and light shone into his hazel
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world will not always put up with the humbugs of the brush, who, to
      imitate Nature, turn their back on her. Paint an out o' door scene
      indoors! I swear by the sun it's a lie! the one stupid, impudent lie that
      glitters among the lies of vulgar art, like Satan among Belial, Mammon and
      all those beggars.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now look here; the barren outlines of a scene must be looked at, to be
      done; hence the sketching system slop-sellers of the Academy! but the
      million delicacies of light, shade, and color can be trusted to memory,
      can they?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lie big enough to shake the earth out of her course; if any part
      of the work could be trusted to memory or imagination, it happens to be
      the bare outlines, and they can't. The million subtleties of light and
      color; learn them by heart, and say them off on canvas! the highest angel
      in the sky must have his eye upon them, and look devilish sharp, too, or
      he shan't paint them. I give him Charles Gatty's word for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's very eloquent, I call it," said Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said poor old Groove, "the lad will never make a painter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I shall, Groove; at least I hope so, but it must be a long time
      first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew a painter who could talk and paint both," explained Mr.
      Groove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Gatty. "Then I'll say but one word more, and it is this.
      The artifice of painting is old enough to die; it is time the art was
      born. Whenever it does come into the world, you will see no more dead
      corpses of trees, grass and water, robbed of their life, the sunlight, and
      flung upon canvas in a studio, by the light of a cigar, and a lie&mdash;and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you expect for your picture?" interrupted Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has that to do with it? With these little swords" (waving his
      brush), "we'll fight for nature-light, truth light, and sunlight against a
      world in arms&mdash;no, worse, in swaddling clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With these little swerrds," replied poor old Groove, "we shall cut our
      own throats if we go against people's prejudices."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young artist laughed the old daubster a merry defiance, and then
      separated from the party, for his lodgings were down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not left them long, before a most musical voice was heard, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A caallerr owoo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And two young fishwives hove in sight. The boys recognized one of them as
      Gatty's sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he in love with her?" inquired Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyacinth the long-haired undertook to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He loves her better than anything in the world except Art. Love and Art
      are two beautiful things," whined Hyacinth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She, too, is beautiful. I have done her," added he, with a simper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In oil?" asked Groove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In oil? no, in verse, here;" and he took out a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then hadn't we better cut? you might propose reading them," said poor old
      Groove.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any oysters?" inquired Jones of the Carnie and the Johnstone,
      who were now alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty," answered Jean. "Hae ye ony siller?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The artists looked at one another, and didn't all speak at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, madam," said old Groove, insinuatingly, to Christie, "am a friend of
      Mr. Gatty's; perhaps, on that account, you would <i>lend</i> me an oyster
      or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na," said Jean, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hyacinth," said Jones, sarcastically, "give them your verses, perhaps
      that will soften them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyacinth gave his verses, descriptive of herself, to Christie. This
      youngster was one of those who mind other people's business.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Alienis studiis delectatus contempsit suum.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      His destiny was to be a bad painter, so he wanted to be an execrable poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this morning he had been doggreling, when he ought to have been
      daubing; and now he will have to sup off a colored print, if he sups at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie read, blushed, and put the verses in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come awa, Custy," said Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hets," said Christie, "gie the puir lads twarree oysters, what the waur
      will we be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So they opened the oysters for them; and Hyacinth the long-haired looked
      down on the others with sarcastico-benignant superiority. He had conducted
      a sister art to the aid of his brother brushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poet's empire, all our hearts allow; But doggrel's power was never
      known till now."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      AT the commencement of the last chapter, Charles Gatty, artist, was going
      to usher in a new state of things, true art, etc. Wales was to be painted
      in Wales, not Poland Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and five or six more youngsters were to be in the foremost files of
      truth, and take the world by storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was at two o'clock; it is now five; whereupon the posture of affairs,
      the prospects of art, the face of the world, the nature of things, are
      quite the reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the artist's room, on the floor, was a small child, whose movements,
      and they were many, were viewed with huge dissatisfaction by Charles
      Gatty, Esq. This personage, pencil in hand, sat slouching and morose,
      looking gloomily at his intractable model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were going on very badly; he had been waiting two hours for an
      infantine pose as common as dirt, and the little viper would die first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of doors everything was nothing, for the sun was obscured, and to all
      appearance extinguished forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Mr. Groove," cried he, to that worthy, who peeped in at that moment;
      "you are right, it is better to plow away upon canvas blindfold, as our
      grandfathers&mdash;no, grandmothers&mdash;used, than to kill ourselves
      toiling after such coy ladies as Nature and Truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel, I dinna ken, sirr," replied Groove, in smooth tones. "I didna like
      to express my warm approbation of you before the lads, for fear of making
      them jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They be&mdash;No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ken what ye wad say, sirr, an it wad hae been a vara just an' sprightly
      observation. Aweel, between oursels, I look upon ye as a young gentleman
      of amazing talent and moedesty. Man, ye dinna do yoursel justice; ye
      should be in th' Academy, at the hede o' 't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Groove, I am a poor fainting pilgrim on the road, where stronger
      spirits have marched erect before me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A faintin' pelgrim! Deil a frights o' ye, ye're a brisk and bonny lad.
      Ah, sirr, in my juvenile days, we didna fash wi nature, and truth, an the
      like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The like! What is like nature and truth, except themselves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vara true, sirr; vara true, and sae I doot I will never attain the height
      o' profeeciency ye hae reached. An' at this vara moment, sir," continued
      Groove, with delicious solemnity and mystery, "ye see before ye, sir, a
      man wha is in maist dismal want&mdash;o' ten shellen!" (A pause.) "If your
      superior talent has put ye in possession of that sum, ye would obleege me
      infinitely by a temporary accommodation, Mr. Gaattie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you not come to the point at once?" cried Gatty, bruskly,
      "instead of humbling me with undeserved praise. There." Groove held out
      his hand, but made a wry face when, instead of money, Gatty put a sketch
      into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," said Gatty, "that is a lie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can it be a lee?" said the other, with sour inadvertence. "How can it
      be a lee, when I hae na spoken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't understand me. That sketch is a libel on a poor cow and an
      unfortunate oak-tree. I did them at the Academy. They had never done me
      any wrong, poor things; they suffered unjustly. You take them to a shop,
      swear they are a tree and a cow, and some fool, that never really looked
      into a cow or a tree, will give you ten shillings for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are ye sure, lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure. Mr. Groove, sir, if you can not sell a lie for ten shillings
      you are not fit to live in this world; where is the lie that will not sell
      for ten shillings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall think the better o' lees all my days; sir, your words are
      inspeeriting." And away went Groove with the sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty reflected and stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On second thoughts, Groove, you must not ask ten shillings; you must ask
      twenty pounds for that rubbish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty pund! What for will I seek twenty pund?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply because people that would not give you ten shillings for it will
      offer you eleven pounds for it if you ask twenty pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fules," roared Groove. "Twenty pund! hem!" He looked closer into it.
      "For a'," said he, "I begin to obsairve it is a work of great merit. I'll
      seek twenty pund, an' I'll no tak less than fifteen schell'n, at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit of this routine painter did not cheer our artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small child got a coal and pounded the floor with it like a machine
      incapable of fatigue. So the wished-for pose seemed more remote than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day waxed darker instead of lighter; Mr. Gatty's reflections took also
      a still more somber hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even Nature spites us," thought he, "because we love her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then cant, tradition, numbers, slang and money are against us; the least
      of these is singly a match for truth; we shall die of despair or paint
      cobwebs in Bedlam; and I am faint, weary of a hopeless struggle; and one
      man's brush is truer than mine, another's is bolder&mdash;my hand and eye
      are not in tune. Ah! no! I shall never, never, never be a painter."
    </p>
    <p>
      These last words broke audibly from him as his head went down almost to
      his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand was placed on his shoulder as a flake of snow falls on the water.
      It was Christie Johnstone, radiant, who had glided in unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrang wi' ye, my lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun is gone to the Devil, for one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! hech! ye'll no be long ahint him; div ye no think shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I want that little brute just to do so, and he'd die first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ye villain, to ca' a bairn a brute; there's but ae brute here, an'
      it's no you, Jamie, nor me&mdash;is it, my lamb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She then stepped to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's clear to windward; in ten minutes ye'll hae plenty sun. Tak your
      tools noo." And at the word she knelt on the floor, whipped out a paper of
      sugar-plums and said to him she had christened "Jamie." "Heb! Here's
      sweeties till ye." Out went Jamie's arms, as if he had been a machine and
      she had pulled the right string.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that will do," said Gatty, and sketched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, Jamie was quickly arrested on the way to immortality by his
      mother, who came in, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I maun hae my bairn&mdash;he canna be aye wasting his time here."
    </p>
    <p>
      This sally awakened the satire that ever lies ready in piscatory bosoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasting his time! ye're no blate. Oh, ye'll be for taking him to the
      college to laern pheesick&mdash;and teach maenners."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye need na begin on me," said the woman. "I'm no match for Newhaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying she cut short the dispute by carrying off the gristle of
      contention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another enemy to art," said Gatty, hurling away his pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fishwife inquired if there were any more griefs. What she had
      heard had not accounted, to her reason, for her companion's depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are ye sick, laddy?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Christie, not sick, but quite, quite down in the mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      She scanned him thirty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What had ye till your dinner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A choep, likely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or maybe it was a steak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say it was a steak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taste my girdle cake, that I've brought for ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a piece; he ate it rapidly, and looked gratefully at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noo, div ye no think shame to look me in the face? Ye hae na dined ava."
      And she wore an injured look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit ye there; it's ower late for dinner, but ye'll get a cup tea. Doon i'
      the mooth, nae wonder, when naething gangs doon your&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a minute she placed a tea-tray, and ran into the kitchen with a teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment a yell was heard, and she returned laughing, with another
      teapot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wife had maskit tea till hersel'," said this lawless forager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea and cake on the table&mdash;beauty seated by his side&mdash;all in
      less than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered her a piece of cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na! I am no for any."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I then," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hets! eat, I tell ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied by putting a bit to her heavenly mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye're awfu' opinionated," said she, with a countenance that said nothing
      should induce her, and eating it almost contemporaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put plenty sugar," added she, referring to the Chinese infusion; "mind, I
      hae a sweet tooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a sweet set," said he, approaching another morsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      They showed themselves by way of smile, and confirmed the accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aha! lad," answered she; "they've been the death o' mony a herrin'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what does that mean in English, Christie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My grinders&mdash;(a full stop.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which you approve&mdash;(a full stop.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have been fatal&mdash;(a full stop.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "To many fishes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie prided herself on her English, which she had culled from books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he made her drink from the cup, and was ostentatious in putting his
      lips to the same part of the brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she left the table, and inspected all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to his drawers, opened one, and was horror-struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were coats and trousers, with their limbs interchangeably
      intertwined, waistcoats, shirts, and cigars, hurled into chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      She instantly took the drawer bodily out, brought it, leaned it against
      the tea-table, pointed silently into it, with an air of majestic reproach,
      and awaited the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can find whatever I want," said the unblushing bachelor, "except
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Siller does na bide wi' slovens! hae ye often siccan a gale o' wind in
      your drawer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every day! Speak English!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel! How <i>do</i> you <i>do?</i> that's Ennglish! I daur say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jolly!" cried he, with his mouth full. Christie was now folding up and
      neatly arranging his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you ever, ever be a painter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a painter! I could paint the Devil pea-green!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinna speak o' yon lad, Chairles, it's no canny."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I am going to paint an angel; the prettiest, cleverest girl in
      Scotland, 'The Snowdrop of the North.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he dashed into his bedroom to find a canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech!" reflected Christie. "Thir Ennglish hae flattering tongues, as sure
      as Dethe; 'The Snawdrap o' the Norrth!'"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      GATTY'S back was hardly turned when a visitor arrived, and inquired, "Is
      Mr. Gatty at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your will wi' him?" was the Scottish reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you give him this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What est?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you fond of asking questions?" inquired the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! and fules canna answer them," retorted Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little document which the man, in retiring, left with Christie
      Johnstone purported to come from one Victoria, who seemed, at first sight,
      disposed to show Charles Gatty civilities. "Victoria&mdash;to Charles
      Gatty, greeting! (salutem)." Christie was much struck with this instance
      of royal affability; she read no further, but began to think, "Victoree!
      that's the queen hersel. A letter fra the queen to a painter lad! Picters
      will rise i' the mairket&mdash;it will be an order to paint the bairns. I
      hae brought him luck; I am real pleased." And on Gatty's return, canvas in
      hand, she whipped the document behind her, and said archly, "I hae
      something for ye, a tecket fra a leddy, ye'll no want siller fra this
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! indeed, fra a great leddy; it's vara gude o' me to gie ye it; heh!
      tak it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did take it, looked stupefied, looked again, sunk into a chair, and
      glared at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laddy!" said Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a new step on the downward path," said the poor painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it no an orrder to paint the young prence?" said Christie, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" almost shrieked the victim. "It's a writ! I owe a lot of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Chairles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See! I borrowed sixty pounds six months ago of a friend, so now I owe
      eighty!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right!" giggled the unfriendly visitor at the door, whose departure
      had been more or less fictitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie, by an impulse, not justifiable, but natural, drew her
      oyster-knife out, and this time the man really went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hairtless mon!" cried she, "could he no do his am dirrty work, and no gar
      me gie the puir lad th' action, and he likeit me sae weel!" and she began
      to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And love you more now," said he; "don't you cry, dear, to add to my
      vexation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na! I'll no add to your vexation," and she gulped down her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, I have pictures painted worth two hundred pounds; this is only
      for eighty. To be sure you can't sell them for two hundred pence when you
      want. So I shall go to jail, but they won't keep me long."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took a turn, and began to fall into the artistic, or true view of
      matters, which, indeed, was never long absent from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Christie," said he, "I am sick of conventional assassins,
      humbugging models, with dirty beards, that knit their brows, and try to
      look murder; they never murdered so much as a tom-cat. I always go in for
      the real thing, and here I shall find it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinna gang in there, lad, for ony favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall find the accessories of a picture I have in my head&mdash;chains
      with genuine rust and ancient mouldering stones with the stains of time."
      His eye brightened at the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You among fiefs, and chains, and stanes! Ye'll break my hairt, laddy,
      ye'll no be easy till you break my hairt." And this time the tears would
      not be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you for crying; don't cry;" and he fished from the chaotic drawer
      a cambric handkerchief, with which he dried her tears as they fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is my firm belief she cried nearly twice as much as she really wanted
      to; she contrived to make the grief hers, the sympathy his. Suddenly she
      stopped, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm daft; ye'll accept a lane o' the siller fra me, will ye no?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said he. "And where could you find eighty pound?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auchty pund," cried she, "it's no auchty pund that will ding Christie
      Johnstone, laddy. I hae boats and nets worth twa auchtys; and I hae forty
      pund laid by; and I hae seven hundred pund at London, but that I canna
      meddle. My feyther lent it the king or the queen, I dinna justly mind; she
      pays me the interest twice the year. Sac ye ken I could na be sae dirty as
      seek my siller, when she pays me th' interest. To the very day, ye ken.
      She's just the only one o' a' my debtors that's hoenest, but never heed,
      ye'll no gang to jail."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll hold my tongue, and sacrifice my pictures," thought Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer up!" said Christie, mistaking the nature of his thoughts, "for it
      did na come fra Victoree hersel'. It wad smell o' the musk, ye ken. Na,
      it's just a wheen blackguards at London that makes use o' her name to
      torment puir folk. Wad she pairsecute a puir lad? No likely."
    </p>
    <p>
      She then asked questions, some of which were embarrassing. One thing he
      could never succeed in making her understand, how, since it was sixty
      pounds he borrowed, it could be eighty pounds he owed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then once more she promised him her protection, bade him be of good cheer,
      and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door she turned, and said: "Chairles, here's an auld wife seeking
      ye," and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two young people had fallen acquainted at a Newhaven wedding.
      Christie, belonging to no one, had danced with him all the night, they had
      walked under the stars to cool themselves, for dancing reels, with heart
      and soul, is not quadrilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he had seen his beautiful partner in Edinburgh, and made a sketch of
      her, which he gave her; and by and by he used to run down to Newhaven, and
      stroll up and down a certain green lane near the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, on Sunday evenings, a long walk together, and then it came to visits
      at his place now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here. Raphael and Fornarina were inverted, our artist used to work,
      and Christie tell him stories the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as her voice curled round his heart, he used to smile and look, and
      lay inspired touches on his subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, an artist of the tongue (without knowing herself one), used to
      make him grave, or gay, or sad, at will, and watch the effect of her art
      upon his countenance; and a very pretty art it is&mdash;the <i>viva voce</i>
      story-teller's&mdash;and a rare one among the nations of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie had not learned it in a day; when she began, she used to tell
      them like the other Newhaven people, with a noble impartiality of detail,
      wearisome to the hearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But latterly she had learned to seize the salient parts of a narrative;
      her voice had compass, and, like all fine speakers, she traveled over a
      great many notes in speaking; her low tones were gorgeously rich, her
      upper tones full and sweet; all this, and her beauty, made the hours she
      gave him very sweet to our poor artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wont to bask in her music, and tell her in return how he loved her,
      and how happy they were both to be as soon as he had acquired a name, for
      a name was wealth, he told her. And although Christie Johnstone did not
      let him see how much she took all this to heart and believed it, it was as
      sweet music to her as her own honeysuckle breath to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She improved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped cigars, and medical students, and similar abominations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie's cool, fresh breath, as she hung over him while painting,
      suggested to him that smoking might, peradventure, be a sin against nature
      as well as against cleanliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he improved her; she learned from art to look into nature (the usual
      process of mind).
    </p>
    <p>
      She had noticed too little the flickering gold of the leaves at evening,
      the purple hills, and the shifting stories and glories of the sky; but
      now, whatever she saw him try to imitate, she learned to examine. She was
      a woman, and admired sunset, etc., for this boy's sake, and her whole
      heart expanded with a new sensation that softened her manner to all the
      world, and brightened her personal rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      This charming picture of mutual affection had hitherto been admired only
      by those who figured in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a visitor had now arrived on purpose to inspect it, etc., attracted by
      report.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend had considerately informed Mrs. Gatty, the artist's mother, and
      she had instantly started from Newcastle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the old lady Christie discovered on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sudden appearance took her son's breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
      No human event was less likely than that she should be there, yet there
      she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first surprise and affectionate greetings, a misgiving crossed
      him, "she must know about the writ"&mdash;it was impossible; but our minds
      are so constituted&mdash;when we are guilty, we fear that others know what
      we know. Now Gatty was particularly anxious she should not know about this
      writ, for he had incurred the debt by acting against her advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year he commenced a picture in which was Durham Cathedral; his mother
      bade him stay quietly at home, and paint the cathedral and its banks from
      a print, "as any other painter would," observed she.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not the lad's system; he spent five months on the spot, and
      painted his picture, but he had to borrow sixty pounds to do this; the
      condition of this loan was, that in six months he should either pay eighty
      pounds, or finish and hand over a certain half-finished picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did neither; his new subject thrust aside his old one, and he had no
      money, ergo, his friend, a picture-dealer, who had found artists slippery
      in money matters, followed him up sharp, as we see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing the matter, I hope, mother. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm tired, Charles." He brought her a seat; she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not come from Newcastle, at my age, for nothing; you have formed an
      improper acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, who? Is it Jack Adams?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worse than any Jack Adams!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can that be? Jenkyns, mother, because he does the same things as
      Jack, and pretends to be religious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a female&mdash;a fishwife. Oh, my son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie Johnstone an improper acquaintance," said he; "why! I was good
      for nothing till I knew her; she has made me so good, mother; so steady,
      so industrious; you will never have to find fault with me again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense&mdash;a woman that sells fish in the streets!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have not seen her. She is beautiful, her mind is not in fish; her
      mind grasps the beautiful and the good&mdash;she is a companion for
      princes! What am I that she wastes a thought or a ray of music on me?
      Heaven bless her. She reads our best authors, and never forgets a word;
      and she tells me beautiful stories&mdash;sometimes they make me cry, for
      her voice is a music that goes straight to my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman that does not even wear the clothes of a lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the only genuine costume in these islands not beneath a painter's
      notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at me, Charles; at your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, mother," said he, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must part with her, or kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He started from his seat and began to flutter up and down the room; poor
      excitable creature. "Part with her!" cried he; "I shall never be a painter
      if I do; what is to keep my heart warm when the sun is hid, when the birds
      are silent, when difficulty looks a mountain and success a molehill? What
      is an artist without love? How is he to bear up against his
      disappointments from within, his mortification from without? the great
      ideas he has and cannot grasp, and all the forms of ignorance that sting
      him, from stupid insensibility down to clever, shallow criticism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back to common sense," said the old lady, coldly and grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked uneasy. Common sense had often been quoted against him, and
      common sense had always proved right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back to common sense. She shall not be your mistress, and she cannot
      bear your name; you must part some day, because you cannot come together,
      and now is the best time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not be together? all our lives, all our lives, ay," cried he, rising into
      enthusiasm, "hundreds of years to come will we two be together before
      men's eyes&mdash;I will be an immortal painter, that the world and time
      may cherish the features I have loved. I love her, mother," added he, with
      a tearful tenderness that ought to have reached a woman's heart; then
      flushing, trembling, and inspired, he burst out, "And I wish I was a
      sculptor and a poet too, that Christie might live in stone and verse, as
      well as colors, and all who love an art might say, 'This woman cannot die,
      Charles Gatty loved her.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked in her face; he could not believe any creature could be
      insensible to his love, and persist to rob him of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman paused, to let his eloquence evaporate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause chilled him; then gently and slowly, but emphatically, she spoke
      to him thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has kept you on her small means ever since you were ten years and
      seven months old?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should know, mother, dear mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer me, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has pinched herself, in every earthly thing, to make you an immortal
      painter, and, above all, a gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who forgave you the little faults of youth, before you could ask pardon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother! Oh, mother, I ask pardon now for all the trouble I ever gave
      the best, the dearest, the tenderest of mothers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will go home to Newcastle, a broken-hearted woman, with the one hope
      gone that has kept her up in poverty and sorrow so many weary years, if
      this goes on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Charles; your mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mother; you have been always my best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And am this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be my worst enemy now. It is for me to obey you; but it is for you
      to think well before you drive me to despair."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the poor womanish heart leaned his head on the table, and began to
      sorrow over his hard fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gatty soothed him. "It need not be done all in a moment. It must be
      done kindly, but firmly. I will give you as much time as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      This bait took; the weak love to temporize.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether he honestly intended to part with Christie
      Johnstone; but to pacify his mother he promised to begin and gradually
      untie the knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother will go," whispered his deceitful heart, "and, when she is
      away, perhaps I shall find out that in spite of every effort I cannot
      resign my treasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sort of half-promise for the sake of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother instantly sent to the inn for her boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a room in this same house," said she, "I will take it; I will
      not hurry you, but until it is done, I stay here, if it is a twelvemonth
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now hear the good news I have brought you from Newcastle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! these little iron wills, how is a great artist to fight three hundred
      and sixty-five days against such an antagonist?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day saw a repetition of these dialogues, in which genius made
      gallant bursts into the air, and strong, hard sense caught him on his
      descent, and dabbed glue on his gauzy wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old age and youth see life so differently. To youth, it is a story-book,
      in which we are to command the incidents, and be the bright exceptions to
      one rule after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      To age it is an almanac, in which everything will happen just as it has
      happened so many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      To youth, it is a path through a sunny meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      To age, a hard turnpike:
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose travelers must be all sweat and dust, when they are not in mud and
      drenched:
    </p>
    <p>
      Which wants mending in many places, and is mended with sharp stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty would not yield to go down to Newhaven and take a step against his
      love, but he yielded so far as to remain passive, and see whether this
      creature was necessary to his existence or not. Mrs. G. scouted the idea.
      "He was to work, and he would soon forget her." Poor boy! he wanted to
      work; his debt weighed on him; a week's resolute labor might finish his
      first picture and satisfy his creditor. The subject was an interior. He
      set to work, he stuck to work, he glued to work, his body&mdash;but his
      heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, my poor fellow, a much slower horse than Gatty will go by you, ridden
      as you are by a leaden heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tu nihil invita facies pingesve Minerva.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not lower a mechanical dog's efforts, but it must yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unhappy. He heard only one side for days; that side was recommended
      by his duty, filial affection, and diffidence of his own good sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was brought to see his proceedings were eccentric, and that it is
      destruction to be eccentric.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was made a little ashamed of what he had been proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was confused and perplexed; he hardly knew what to think or do; he
      collapsed, and all his spirit was fast leaving him, and then he felt
      inclined to lean on the first thing he could find, and nothing came to
      hand but his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Christie Johnstone was also thinking of him, but her single
      anxiety was to find this eighty pounds for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a Newhaven idea that the female is the natural protector of the
      male, and this idea was strengthened in her case.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not fully comprehend his character and temperament, but she saw,
      by instinct, that she was to be the protector. Besides, as she was
      twenty-one, and he only twenty-two, she felt the difference between
      herself, a woman, and him, a boy, and to leave him to struggle unaided out
      of his difficulties seemed to her heartless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice she opened her lips to engage the charitable "vile count" in his
      cause, but shame closed them again; this would be asking a personal favor,
      and one on so large a scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several days passed thus; she had determined not to visit him without good
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then began to be surprised, she heard nothing from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she felt something that prevented her calling on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jean Carnie was to be married, and the next day the wedding party were
      to spend in festivity upon the island of Inch Coombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bade Jean call on him, and, without mentioning her, invite him to this
      party, from which, he must know, she would not be absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Carnie entered his apartment, and at her entrance his mother, who
      took for granted this was his sweetheart, whispered in his ear that he
      should now take the first step, and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What passed between Jean Carnie and Charles Gatty is for another chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A YOUNG viscount with income and person cannot lie <i>perdu</i> three
      miles from Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      First one discovers him, then another, then twenty, then all the world, as
      the whole clique is modestly called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before, however, Lord Ipsden was caught, he had acquired a browner tint, a
      more elastic step, and a stouter heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Aberford prescription had done wonders for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught himself passing one whole day without thinking of Lady Barbara
      Sinclair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even Aberford had misled him; there were no adventures to be found in
      the Firth of Forth; most of the days there was no wind to speak of; twice
      it blew great guns, and the men were surprised at his lordship going out,
      but nobody was in any danger except himself; the fishermen had all slipped
      into port before matters were serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the merchantmen that could sail creeping on with three reefs in
      their mainsail; and the Dutchmen lying to and breasting it, like ducks in
      a pond, and with no more chance of harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one of these occasions he did observe a little steam-tug, going about a
      knot an hour, and rolling like a washing-tub. He ran down to her, and
      asked if he could assist her; she answered, through the medium of a sooty
      animal at her helm, that she was (like our universities) "satisfied with
      her own progress"; she added, being under intoxication, "that, if any
      danger existed, her scheme was to drown it in the bo-o-owl;" and two days
      afterward he saw her puffing and panting, and fiercely dragging a gigantic
      three-decker out into deep water, like an industrious flea pulling his
      phaeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it is my office to relate how Mr. Flucker Johnstone comported
      himself on one occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the yacht worked alongside Granton Pier, before running out, the said
      Flucker calmly and scientifically drew his lordship's attention to three
      points:
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction of the wind&mdash;the force of the wind&mdash;and his
      opinion, as a person experienced in the Firth, that it was going to be
      worse instead of better; in reply, he received an order to step forward to
      his place in the cutter&mdash;the immediate vicinity of the jib-boom. On
      this, Mr. Flucker instantly burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, or, as Flucker called him ever since the yacht came down,
      "the skipper," deeming that the higher appellation, inquired, with some
      surprise, what was the matter with the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the crew, who, by the by, squinted, suggested, "It was a slight
      illustration of the passion of fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker confirmed the theory by gulping out: "We'll never see Newhaven
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this the skipper smiled, and ordered him ashore, somewhat peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straightway he began to howl, and, saying, "It was better to be drowned
      than be the laughing-stock of the place," went forward to his place; on
      his safe return to port, this young gentleman was very severe on open
      boats, which, he said "bred womanish notions in hearts naturally
      dauntless. Give me a lid to the pot," added he, "and I'll sail with Old
      Nick, let the wind blow high or low."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Aberford was wrong when he called love a cutaneous disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are cutaneous disorders that take that name, but they are no more
      love than verse is poetry;
    </p>
    <p>
      Than patriotism is love of country;
    </p>
    <p>
      Than theology is religion;
    </p>
    <p>
      Than science is philosophy;
    </p>
    <p>
      Than paintings are pictures;
    </p>
    <p>
      Than reciting on the boards is acting;
    </p>
    <p>
      Than physic is medicine
    </p>
    <p>
      Than bread is bread, or gold gold&mdash;in shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love is a state of being; the beloved object is our center; and our
      thoughts, affections, schemes and selves move but round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may diverge hither or thither, but the golden thread still holds us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is fair or dark beauty the fairest? The world cannot decide; but love
      shall decide in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A halo surrounds her we love, and makes beautiful to us her movements, her
      looks, her virtues, her faults, her nonsense, her affectation and herself;
      and that's love, doctor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden was capable of loving like this; but, to do Lady Barbara
      justice, she had done much to freeze the germ of noble passion; she had
      not killed, but she had benumbed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders," said Lord Ipsden, one morning after breakfast, "have you
      entered everything in your diary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All these good people's misfortunes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think you have spelled their names right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where it was impossible, my lord, I substituted an English appellation,
      hidentical in meaning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you entered and described my first interview with Christie
      Johnstone, and somebody something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most minutely, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How I turned Mr. Burke into poetry&mdash;how she listened with her eyes
      all glistening&mdash;how they made me talk&mdash;how she dropped a tear,
      he! he! he! at the death of the first baron&mdash;how shocked she was at
      the king striking him when he was dying, to make a knight-banneret of the
      poor old fellow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship will find all the particulars exactly related," said
      Saunders, with dry pomp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How she found out that titles are but breath&mdash;how I answered&mdash;some
      nonsense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship will find all the topics included."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How she took me for a madman? And you for a prig?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The latter circumstance eluded my memory, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But when I told her I must relieve only one poor person by day, she took
      my hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship will find all the items realized in this book, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a beautiful book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alba are considerably ameliorated, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alba?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plural of album, my lord," explained the refined factotum, "more
      delicate, I conceive, than the vulgar reading."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viscount Ipsden read from
    </p>
    <p>
      "MR. SAUNDERS'S ALBUM.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To illustrate the inelegance of the inferior classes, two juvenile
      venders of the piscatory tribe were this day ushered in, and
      instantaneously, without the accustomed preliminaries, plunged into a
      familiar conversation with Lord Viscount Ipsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their vulgarity, shocking and repulsive to myself, appeared to afford his
      lordship a satisfaction greater than he derives from the graceful
      amenities of fashionable association&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders, I suspect you of something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, my lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Writing in an annual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, my lord," said he, with benignant <i>hauteur.</i> "It appears every
      month&mdash;<i>The Polytechnic."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so! you are polysyllabic, Saunders; <i>en route!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this hallucination I find it difficult to participate; associated from
      infancy with the aristocracy, I shrink, like the sensitive plant, from
      contact with anything vulgar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see! I begin to understand you, Saunders. Order the dog-cart, and
      Wordsworth's mare for leader; we'll give her a trial. You are an ass,
      Saunders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord; I will order Robert to tell James to come for your
      lordship's commands about your lordship's vehicles. (What could he intend
      by a recent observation of a discourteous character?)"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship soliloquized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never observed it before, but Saunders is an ass! La Johnstone is one
      of Nature's duchesses, and she has made me know some poor people that will
      be richer than the rich one day; and she has taught me that honey is to be
      got from bank-notes&mdash;by merely giving them away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the objects of charity Lord Ipsden discovered was one Thomas Harvey,
      a maker and player of the violin. This man was a person of great
      intellect; he mastered every subject he attacked. By a careful examination
      of all the points that various fine-toned instruments had in common, he
      had arrived at a theory of sound; he made violins to correspond, and was
      remarkably successful in insuring that which had been too hastily ascribed
      to accident&mdash;a fine tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, who was in needy circumstances, demonstrated to his lordship
      that ten pounds would make his fortune; because with ten pounds he could
      set up a shop, instead of working out of the world's sight in a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden gave him ten pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after, he met Harvey, more ragged and dirty than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey had been robbed by a friend whom he had assisted. Poor Harvey! Lord
      Ipsden gave him ten pounds more!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next week, Saunders, entering Harvey's house, found him in bed at noon,
      because he had no clothes to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders suggested that it would be better to give his wife the next
      money, with strict orders to apply it usefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, Harvey, finding his clothes upon a chair, his tools redeemed
      from pawn, and a beefsteak ready for his dinner, accused his wife of
      having money, and meanly refusing him the benefit of it. She acknowledged
      she had a little, and appealed to the improved state of things as a proof
      that she knew better than he the use of money. He demanded the said money.
      She refused&mdash;he leathered her&mdash;she put him in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the best place for him. The man was a drunkard, and all the
      riches of Egypt would never have made him better off.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here, gentlemen of the lower classes, a word with you. How can you,
      with your small incomes, hope to be well off, if you are more extravagant
      than those who have large ones?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Us extravagant?" you reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! your income is ten shillings a week; out of that you spend three
      shillings in drink; ay! you, the sober ones. You can't afford it, my boys.
      Find me a man whose income is a thousand a year; well, if he imitates you,
      and spends three hundred upon sensuality, I bet you the odd seven hundred
      he does not make both ends meet; the proportion is too great. And <i>two-thirds
      of the distress of the lower orders is owing to this&mdash;that they are
      more madly prodigal than the rich; in the worst, lowest and most dangerous
      item of all human prodigality!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden went to see Mrs. Harvey; it cost him much to go; she lived in
      the Old Town, and he hated disagreeable smells; he also knew from Saunders
      that she had two black eyes, and he hated women with black eyes of that
      sort. But this good creature did go; did relieve Mrs. Harvey; and,
      bare-headed, suffered himself to be bedewed ten minutes by her tearful
      twaddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Virtue was rewarded. Returning over the North Bridge, he met
      somebody whom but for his charity he would not have met.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in one bright moment plump upon&mdash;Lady Barbara Sinclair. She
      flushed, he trembled, and in two minutes he had forgotten every human
      event that had passed since he was by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed pleased to see him, too; she ignored entirely his obnoxious
      proposal; he wisely took her cue, and so, on this secret understanding,
      they were friends. He made his arrangements, and dined with her family. It
      was a family party. In the evening Lady Barbara allowed it to transpire
      that she had made inquiries about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He was highly flattered.) And she had discovered he was lying hid
      somewhere in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Studying the guitar?" inquired she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said he, "studying a new class of the community. Do you know any of
      what they call the 'lower classes'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monstrous agreeable people, are they not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, very stupid! I only know two old women&mdash;except the servants, who
      have no characters. They imitate us, I suspect, which does not say much
      for their taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But some of my friends are young women; that makes all the difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does! and you ought to be ashamed. If you want a low order of mind,
      why desert our own circle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friends are only low in station; they have rather lofty minds, some of
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, amuse yourself with these lofty minds. Amusement is the end of
      being, you know, and the aim of all the men of this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We imitate the ladies," said he, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do," answered she, very dryly; and so the dialogue went on, and Lord
      Ipsden found the pleasure of being with his cousin compensate him fully
      for the difference of their opinions; in fact, he found it simply amusing
      that so keen a wit as his cousins s could be entrapped into the humor of
      decrying the time one happens to live in, and admiring any epoch one knows
      next to nothing about, and entrapped by the notion of its originality,
      above all things; the idea being the stale commonplace of asses in every
      age, and the manner of conveying the idea being a mere imitation of the
      German writers, not the good ones, <i>bien entendu,</i> but the
      quill-drivers, the snobs of the Teutonic pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was to learn that follies are not always laughable, that <i>eadem
      sentire</i> is a bond, and that, when a clever and pretty woman chooses to
      be a fool, her lover, if he is wise, will be a greater&mdash;if he can.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time they met, Lord Ipsden found Lady Barbara occupied with a
      gentleman whose first sentence proclaimed him a pupil of Mr. Thomas
      Carlyle, and he had the mortification to find that she had neither an ear
      nor an eye for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Human opinion has so many shades that it is rare to find two people agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But two people may agree wonderfully, if they will but let a third think
      for them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that these two ran so smoothly in couples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antiquity, they agreed, was the time when the world was old, its hair
      gray, its head wise. Every one that said, "Lord, Lord!" two hundred years
      ago was a Christian. There were no earnest men now; Williams, the
      missionary, who lived and died for the Gospel, was not earnest in
      religion; but Cromwell, who packed a jury, and so murdered his prisoner&mdash;Cromwell,
      in whose mouth was heaven, and in his heart temporal sovereignty&mdash;was
      the pattern of earnest religion, or, at all events, second in sincerity to
      Mahomet alone, in the absence of details respecting Satan, of whom we know
      only that his mouth is a Scripture concordance, and his hands the hands of
      Mr. Carlyle's saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went back a century or two, and were eloquent about the great
      antique heart, and the beauty of an age whose samples were Abbot Sampson
      and Joan of Arc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden hated argument; but jealousy is a brass spur, it made even
      this man fluent for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suggested "that five hundred years added to a world's life made it just
      five hundred years older, not younger&mdash;and if older, grayer&mdash;and
      if grayer, wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of Abbot Sampson," said he, "whom I confess both a great and a good man,
      his author, who with all his talent belongs to the class muddle-head,
      tells us that when he had been two years in authority his red hair had
      turned gray, fighting against the spirit of his age; how the deuce, then,
      could he be a sample of the spirit of his age?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joan of Arc was burned by acclamation of her age, and is admired by our
      age. Which fact identifies an age most with a heroine, to give her your
      heart, or to give her a blazing fagot and death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abbot Sampson and Joan of Arc," concluded he, "prove no more in favor of
      their age, and no less against it, than Lot does for or against Sodom. Lot
      was in Sodom, but not of it; and so were Sampson and Joan in, but not of,
      the villainous times they lived in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very best text-book of true religion is the New Testament, and I
      gather from it, that the man who forgives his enemies while their ax
      descends on his head, however poor a creature he may be in other respects,
      is a better Christian than the man who has the God of Mercy forever on his
      lips, and whose hands are swift to shed blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The earnest men of former ages are not extinct in this," added he.
      "Whenever a scaffold is erected outside a prison-door, if you are earnest
      in pursuit of truth, and can put up with disgusting objects, you shall see
      a relic of ancient manners hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There still exist, in parts of America, rivers on whose banks are earnest
      men who shall take your scalp, the wife's of your bosom, and the innocent
      child's of her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In England we are as earnest as ever in pursuit of heaven, and of
      innocent worldly advantages. If, when the consideration of life and death
      interposes, we appear less earnest in pursuit of comparative trifles such
      as kingdoms or dogmas, it is because cooler in action we are more earnest
      in thought&mdash;because reason, experience, and conscience are things
      that check the unscrupulousness or beastly earnestness of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moreover, he who has the sense to see that questions have three sides is
      no longer so intellectually as well as morally degraded as to be able to
      cut every throat that utters an opinion contrary to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the phrase 'earnest man' means man imitating the beasts that are deaf
      to reason, it is to be hoped that civilization and Christianity will
      really extinguish the whole race for the benefit of the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden succeeded in annoying the fair theorist, but not in convincing
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mediaeval enthusiasts looked on him as some rough animal that had
      burst into sacred grounds unconsciously, and gradually edged away from
      him.

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LORD IPSDEN had soon the mortification of discovering that this Mr.
      &mdash;&mdash; was a constant visitor at the house; and, although his
      cousin gave him her ear in this man's absence, on the arrival of her
      fellow-enthusiast he had ever the mortification of finding himself <i>de
      trop.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice he demolished this personage in argument, and was rewarded
      by finding himself more <i>de trop.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      But one day Lady Barbara, being in a cousinly humor, expressed a wish to
      sail in his lordship's yacht, and this hint soon led to a party being
      organized, and a sort of picnic on the island of Inch Coombe; his
      lordship's cutter being the mode of conveyance to and from that spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened on that very day Jean Carnie's marriage was celebrated on
      that very island by her relations and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that we shall introduce our readers to
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RIVAL PICNICS.
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin with <i>Les gens comme il faut.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      PICNIC NO. 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants were employed in putting away dishes into hampers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a calm silence. "Hem!" observed Sir Henry Talbot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" replied the Honorable Tom Hitherington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mamma," said Miss Vere, "have you brought any work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At a picnic," said Mr. Hitherington, "isn't it the thing for somebody&mdash;aw&mdash;to
      do something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ipsden," said Lady Barbara, "there is an understanding <i>between</i> you
      and Mr. Hitherington. I condemn you to turn him into English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Lady Barbara; I'll tell you, he means&mdash;-do you mean anything,
      Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hitherington.</i> "Can't anybody guess what I mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barbara.</i> "Guess first yourself, you can't be suspected of
      being in the secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hither.</i> "What I mean is, that people sing a song, or run races, or
      preach a sermon, or do something funny at a picnic&mdash;aw&mdash;somebody
      gets up and does something."

      to the black art of law; it all filters through them without leaving any

      Here Lord Ipsden, after a word to Lady Barbara, the answer to which did
      not appear to be favorable, rose, gave a little yawn, looked steadily at
      his companions without seeing them, and departed without seeming aware
      that he was leaving anybody behind him.

      PICNIC NO. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a house, two hundred yards from this scene, a merry dance, succeeding a
      merry song, had ended, and they were in the midst of an interesting story;
      Christie Johnstone was the narrator. She had found the tale in one of the
      viscount's books&mdash;it had made a great impression on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest were listening intently. In a room which had lately been all
      noise, not a sound was now to be heard but the narrator's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel, lasses, here are the three wee kists set, the lads are to chuse&mdash;the
      ane that chuses reicht is to get Porsha, an' the lave to get the bag, and
      dee baitchelars&mdash;Flucker Johnstone, you that's sae clever&mdash;are
      ye for gowd, or siller, or leed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>1st Fishwife.</i> "Gowd for me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2d ditto.</i> "The white siller's my taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Na! there's aye some deevelish trick in thir lassie's
      stories. I shall ha to, till the ither lads hae chused; the mair part will
      put themsels oot, ane will hit it off reicht maybe, then I shall gie him a
      hidin' an' carry off the lass. You-hoo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean Carnie.</i> "That's you, Flucker."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie Johnstone.</i> "And div ye really think we are gawn to let you
      see a' the world chuse? Na, lad, ye are putten oot o' the room, like
      witnesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Then I'd toss a penny; for gien ye trust to luck, she
      whiles favors ye, but gien ye commence to reason and argefy&mdash;ye're
      done!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "The suitors had na your wit, my manny, or maybe they had
      na a penny to toss, sae ane chused the gowd, ane the siller; but they got
      an awfu' affront. The gold kist had just a skull intil't, and the siller a
      deed cuddy's head!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Chorus of Females.</i> "He! he! he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ditto of Males.</i> "Haw! haw! haw! haw! Ho!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "An' Porsha puttit the pair of gowks to the door. Then
      came Bassanio, the lad fra Veeneece, that Porsha loed in secret. Veeneece,
      lasses, is a wonderful city; the streets o' 't are water, and the
      carriages are boats&mdash;that's in Chambers'."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Wha are ye making a fool o'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "What's wrang?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Yon's just as big a lee as ever I heerd."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were scarcely out of his mouth ere he had reason to regret them;
      a severe box on the ear was administered by his indignant sister. Nobody
      pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "I'll laern yet' affront me before a' the company."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean Carnie.</i> "Suppose it's a lee, there's nae silver to pay for it,
      Flucker."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Jean, I never telt a lee in a' my days."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean.</i> "There's ane to begin wi' then. Go ahead, Custy."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "She bade the music play for him, for music brightens
      thoucht; ony way, he chose the leed kist. Open'st and wasn't there
      Porsha's pictur, and a posy, that said:
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you be well pleased with this, And hold your fortune for your bliss;
      Turn you where your leddy iss, And greet her wi' a loving&mdash;'" <i>(Pause).</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kess," roared the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Chorus, led by Flucker.</i> "Hurraih!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie (pathetically).</i> "Flucker, behave!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sandy Liston (drunk).</i> "Hur-raih!" He then solemnly reflected. "Na!
      but it's na hurraih, decency requires amen first an' hurraih afterward;
      here's kissin plenty, but I hear nae word o' the minister. Ye'll obsairve,
      young woman, that kissin's the prologue to sin, and I'm a decent mon, an'
      a gray-headed mon, an' your licht stories are no for me; sae if the
      minister's no expeckit I shall retire&mdash;an' tak my quiet gill my
      lane."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean Carnie.</i> "And div ye really think a decent cummer like Custy
      wad let the lad and lass misbehave thirsels? Na! lad, the minister's at
      the door, but" (sinking her voice to a confidential whisper) "I daurna let
      him in, for fear he'd see ye hae putten the enemy in your mooth sae aerly.
      (That's Custy's word.)"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jemmy Drysel," replied Sandy, addressing vacancy, for Jemmy was
      mysteriously at work in the kitchen, "ye hae gotten a thoughtfu' wife."
      (Then, with a strong revulsion of feeling.) "Dinna let the blackguard* in
      here," cried he, "to spoil the young folk's sporrt."

      in a bit whisper to Shylock, 'Shylock, there's thrice thy money offered

      He rose, and was instantly seized by two of the company, from whom he
      burst furiously, after a struggle, and the next moment was heard to fall
      clean from the top to the bottom of the stairs. Flucker and Jean ran out;
      the rest appealed against the interruption.

      <i>Christie.</i> "Hech! hech! he was my pupil in the airt o' sobriety!&mdash;aweel,
      the young judge rises to deliver the sentence of the coort. Silence!"
      thundered Christie. A lad and a lass that were slightly flirting were
      discountenanced.

      shall cut the flesh frae off his breest.'&mdash;'A sentence,' says
      Shylock, 'come, prepare.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie made a dash <i>en Shylock,</i> and the company trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "'Bide a wee,' says the judge, 'this boend gies ye na a

      <i>Christie (with dismal pathos).</i> "Oh, Jean! yon's an awfu' voolgar
      exprassion to come fra' a woman's mooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could ye no hae said, 'intil his bacon'?" said Lizzie Johnstone,
      confirming the remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "'Then tak your boend, an' your pund o' flesh, but in

      <i>Christie.</i> "'Thy goods are by the laws Veneece con-fis-cate,

    </p>
    <p>
      Then, like an artful narrator, she began to wind up the story more
      rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sae Shylock got to be no sae saucy. 'Pay the boend thrice,' says he, 'and

      sae; ance they'd gotten the Jew on the hep, they worried him, like good
      Christians, that's a fact. The judge fand a law that fitted him, for
      conspiring against the life of a citizen; an' he behooved to give up hoose
      an' lands, and be a Christian; yon was a soor drap&mdash;he tarned no

    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden, who had been an unobserved auditor of the latter part of the
      tale, here inquired whether she had brought her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'n buik?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your music-book!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's my music-book," said Jean, roughly tapping her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And here's mines," said Christie, birdly, touching her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard," said she, thoughtfully, "I wish ye may no hae been getting in
      voolgar company. Div ye think we hae minds like rinning water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker (avec malice).</i> "And tongues like the mill-clack abune it?
      Because if ye think sae, captain&mdash;ye're no far wrang!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Na! we hae na muckle gowd maybe; but our minds are
      gowden vessels."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean.</i> "Aha! lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "They are not saxpenny sieves, to let music an' meter
      through, and leave us none the wiser or better. Dinna gang in low voolgar
      company, or you a lost laddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "Vulgar, again! everybody has a different sense for that
      word, I think. What is vulgar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Voolgar folk sit on an chair, ane, twa, whiles three
      hours, eatin' an' abune drinkin', as still as hoegs, or gruntin' puir
      every-day clashes, goessip, rubbich; when ye are aside them, ye might as
      weel be aside a cuddy; they canna gie ye a sang, they canna gie ye a
      story, they canna think ye a thoucht, to save their useless lives; that's
      voolgar folk."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sings. "A caaller herrin'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean.</i> "A caaller herrin'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Omnes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come buy my bonny caaller herrin', Six a penny caaller from the sea,"
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music chimed in, and the moment the song was done, without pause, or
      anything to separate or chill the succession of the arts, the fiddles
      diverged with a gallant plunge into "The Dusty Miller." The dancers found
      their feet by an instinct as rapid, and a rattling reel shook the floor
      like thunder. Jean Carnie assumed the privilege of a bride, and seized his
      lordship; Christie, who had a mind to dance with him too, took Flucker
      captive, and these four were one reel! There were seven others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principle of reel dancing is articulation; the foot strikes the ground
      for every <i>accented</i> note (and, by the by, it is their weakness of
      accent which makes all English reel and hornpipe players such failures).
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the best steps of all, which it has in common with the hornpipe,
      such as the quick "heel and toe," "the sailor's fling," and the "double
      shuffle," the foot strikes the ground for every <i>single</i> note of the
      instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      All good dancing is beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this articulate dancing, compared with the loose, lawless diffluence
      of motion that goes by that name, gives me (I must confess it) as much
      more pleasure as articulate singing is superior to tunes played on the
      voice by a young lady:
    </p>
    <p>
      Or the clean playing of my mother to the piano-forte splashing of my
      daughter; though the latter does attack the instrument as a washerwoman
      her soapsuds, and the former works like a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or skating to sliding:
    </p>
    <p>
      Or English verse to dactyls in English:
    </p>
    <p>
      Or painting to daubing:
    </p>
    <p>
      Or preserved strawberries to strawberry jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      What says Goldsmith of the two styles? "They swam, sprawled, frisked, and
      languished; but Olivia's foot was as pat to the music as its echo."&mdash;<i>Vicar
      of Wakefield.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Newhaven dancing aims also at fun; laughter mingles with agility;
      grotesque yet graceful gestures are flung in, and little inspiring cries
      flung out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship soon entered into the spirit of it. Deep in the mystery of
      the hornpipe, he danced one or two steps Jean and Christie had never seen,
      but their eyes were instantly on his feet, and they caught in a minute and
      executed these same steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see Christie Johnstone do the double-shuffle with her arms so saucily
      akimbo, and her quick elastic foot at an angle of forty-five, was a treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dance became inspiriting, inspiring, intoxicating; and, when the
      fiddles at last left off, the feet went on another seven bars by the
      enthusiastic impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, alternately spinning yarns, singing songs, dancing, and making
      fun, and mingling something of heart and brain in all, these benighted
      creatures made themselves happy instead of peevish, and with a day of
      stout, vigorous, healthy pleasure, refreshed, indemnified, and warmed
      themselves for many a day of toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the two picnics of Inch Coombe, and these rival cliques,
      agreeing in nothing else, would have agreed in this: each, if allowed (but
      we won't allow either) to judge the other, would have pronounced the same
      verdict:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Ils ne savent pas vivre ces gens-l'a."</i>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two of our personages left Inch Coombe less happy than when they came to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden encountered Lady Barbara with Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, who had
      joined her upon the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found them discoursing, as usual, about the shams of the present day,
      and the sincerity of Cromwell and Mahomet, and he found himself <i>de
      trop.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They made him, for the first time, regret the loss of those earnest times
      when, "to avoid the inconvenience of both addressing the same lady," you
      could cut a rival's throat at once, and be smiled on by the fair and
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a book-maker should blaspheme high civilization, by which alone he
      exists, and one of whose diseases and flying pains he is, neither
      surprised nor moved him; but that any human being's actions should be
      affected by such tempestuous twaddle was ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that the witty Lady Barbara should be caught by this chaff was
      intolerable; he began to feel bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the blessings of the poor, the good opinion of the world; every
      living creature was prepossessed in his favor but one, and that one
      despised him; it was a diabolical prejudice; it was the spiteful caprice
      of his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart, for a moment, was in danger of deteriorating. He was miserable;
      the Devil suggested to him, "make others miserable too;" and he listened
      to the advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fine breeze, but instead of sailing on a wind, as he might
      have done, he made a series of tacks, and all were ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earnest man first; and Flucker announced the skipper's insanity to the
      whole town of Newhaven, for, of course, these tacks were all marine
      solecisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other discontented Picnician was Christie Johnstone. Gatty never came;
      and this, coupled with five or six days' previous neglect, could no longer
      pass unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gayety failed her before the afternoon was ended; and the last two
      hours were spent by her alone, watching the water on all sides for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, long after the departure of his lordship's yacht, the Newhaven
      boat sailed from Inch Coombe with the wedding party. There was now a
      strong breeze, and the water every now and then came on board. So the men
      set the foresail with two reefs, and drew the mainsail over the women; and
      there, as they huddled together in the dark, Jean Carnie discovered that
      our gay story-teller's eyes were wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean said nothing; she embraced her; and made them flow faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when they came alongside the pier, Jean, who was the first to get her
      head from under the sail, whipped it back again and said to Christie:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here he is, Christie; dinna speak till him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And sure enough there was, in the twilight, with a pale face and an uneasy
      look&mdash;Mr. Charles Gatty!
    </p>
    <p>
      He peered timidly into the boat, and, when he saw Christie, an "Ah!" that
      seemed to mean twenty different things at once, burst from his bosom. He
      held out his arm to assist her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast on him one glance of mute reproach, and, placing her foot on the
      boat's gunwale, sprang like an antelope upon the pier, without accepting
      his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going further, we must go back for this boy, and conduct him from
      where we left him up to the present point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he found himself alone with Jean Carnie, in his own house, he
      began to tell her what trouble he was in; how his mother had convinced him
      of his imprudence in falling in love with Christie Johnstone; and how she
      insisted on a connection being broken off which had given him his first
      glimpse of heaven upon earth, and was contrary to common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean heard him out, and then, with the air of a lunatic-asylum keeper to a
      rhodomontading patient, told him "he was one fool, and his mother was
      another." First she took him up on the score of prudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You," said she, "are a beggarly painter, without a rap; Christie has
      houses, boats, nets, and money; you are in debt; she lays by money every
      week. It is not prudent on her part to take up with you&mdash;the better
      your bargain, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the head of common sense, which she maintained was all on the same
      side of the question, she calmly inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could an old woman of sixty be competent to judge how far human
      happiness depends on love, when she has no experience of that passion, and
      the reminiscences of her youth have become dim and dark? You might as well
      set a judge in court, that has forgotten the law&mdash;common sense," said
      she, "the old wife is sixty, and you are twenty&mdash;what can she do for
      you the forty years you may reckon to outlive her? Who is to keep you
      through those weary years but the wife of your own choice, not your
      mother's? You English does na read the Bible, or ye'd ken that a lad is to
      'leave his father and mother, and cleave until his wife,'" added she; then
      with great contempt she repeated, "common sense, indeed! ye're fou wi'
      your common sense; ye hae the name o' 't pat eneuch&mdash;but there's na
      muckle o' that mairchandise in your harns."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty was astonished. What! was there really common sense on the side of
      bliss? and when Jean told him to join her party at Inch Coombe, or never
      look her in the face again, scales seemed to fall from his eyes; and, with
      a heart that turned in a moment from lead to a feather, he vowed he would
      be at Inch Coombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then begged Jean on no account to tell Christie the struggle he had
      been subjected to, since his scruples were now entirely conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean acquiesced at once, and said: "Indeed, she would be very sorry to
      give the lass that muckle pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hinted, moreover, that her neebor's spirit was so high, she was quite
      capable of breaking with him at once upon such an intimation; and she,
      Jean, was "nae mischief-maker."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the energy of his gratitude, he kissed this dark-browed beauty,
      professing to see in her a sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she made no resistance to this way of showing gratitude, but muttered
      between her teeth, "He's just a bairn!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she went about her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her retreat, his mother returned to him, and, with a sad air, hoped
      nothing that that rude girl had said had weakened his filial duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, mother," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then, without explaining how she came acquainted with Jean's
      arguments, proceeded to demolish them one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your mother is old and experienced," said she, "benefit by her age and
      experience. She has not forgotten love, nor the ills it leads to, when not
      fortified by prudence. Scripture says a man shall cleave to his wife when
      he has left his parents; but in making that, the most important step of
      life, where do you read that he is to break the fifth commandment? But I
      do you wrong, Charles, you never could have listened to that vulgar girl
      when she told you your mother was not your best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "N&mdash;no, mother, of course not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will not go to that place to break my heart, and undo all you
      have done this week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like to go, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will break my heart if you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie will feel herself slighted, and she has not deserved this
      treatment from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other will explain to her, and if she is as good a girl as you say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is an angel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can a fishwife be an angel? Well, then, she will not set a son to
      disobey his mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think she would! but is all the goodness to be on her side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Charles, you do your part; deny yourself, be an obedient child, and
      your mother's blessing and the blessing of Heaven will rest upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he was not to go to Inch Coombe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed at home, his mother set him to work; he made a poor hand of it,
      he was so wretched. She at last took compassion on him, and in the
      evening, when it was now too late for a sail to Inch Coombe, she herself
      recommended a walk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor boy's feet took him toward Newhaven, not that he meant to go to
      his love, but he could not forbear from looking at the place which held
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to return, when a spacious blue jacket hailed him. Somewhere
      inside this jacket was Master Flucker, who had returned in the yacht,
      leaving his sister on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty instantly poured out a flood of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baddish boy reciprocated fluency. He informed him "that his sister had
      been the star of a goodly company, and that, her own lad having stayed
      away, she had condescended to make a conquest of the skipper himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He had come in quite at the tag-end of one of her stories, but it had
      been sufficient to do his business&mdash;he had danced with her, had even
      whistled while she sung. (Hech, it was bonny!)
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when the cutter sailed, he, Flucker, had seen her perched on a rock,
      like a mermaid, watching their progress, which had been slow, because the
      skipper, infatuated with so sudden a passion, had made a series of
      ungrammatical tacks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For his part he was glad," said the gracious Flucker; "the lass was a
      prideful hussy, that had given some twenty lads a sore heart and him many
      a sore back; and he hoped his skipper, with whom he naturally identified
      himself rather than with his sister, would avenge the male sex upon her."
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he went upon this tack till he drove poor Gatty nearly mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a new feeling superadded; at first he felt injured, but on
      reflection what cause of complaint had he?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had neglected her; he might have been her partner&mdash;he had left her
      to find one where she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fool, to suppose that so beautiful a creature would ever be neglected&mdash;except
      by him!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He determined to see her, to ask her forgiveness, to tell her everything,
      to beg her to decide, and, for his part, he would abide by her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie Johnstone, as we have already related, declined his arm, sprang
      like a deer upon the pier, and walked toward her home, a quarter of a mile
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty followed her, disconsolately, hardly knowing what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, observing that she drew near enough to the wall to allow room for
      another on the causeway, he had just nous enough to creep alongside and
      pull her sleeve somewhat timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie, I want to speak to you:"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can ye hae to say till me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie, I am very unhappy; and I want to tell you why, but I have
      hardly the strength or the courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye shall come ben my hoose if ye are unhappy, and we'll hear your story;
      come away."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never been admitted into her house before.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found it clean as a snowdrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a bright fire, and Flucker frying innumerable steaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baddish boy had obtained them in his sister's name and at her expense,
      at the flesher's, and claimed credit for his affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Potatoes he had boiled in their jackets, and so skillfully, that those
      jackets hung by a thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie laid an unbleached table-cloth, that somehow looked sweeter than
      a white one, as brown bread is sweeter than white.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lo! Gatty could not eat; so then Christie would not, because he
      refused her cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baddish boy chuckled, and addressed himself to the nice brown steaks
      with their rich gravy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On such occasions a solo on the knife and fork seemed better than a trio
      to the gracious Flucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie moved about the room, doing little household matters; Gatty's eye
      followed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her beauty lost nothing in this small apartment; she was here, like a
      brilliant in some quaint, rough setting, which all earth's jewelers should
      despise, and all its poets admire, and it should show off the stone and
      not itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her beauty filled the room, and almost made the spectators ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty asked himself whether he could really have been such a fool as to
      think of giving up so peerless a creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly an idea occurred to him, a bright one, and not inconsistent with
      a true artist's character&mdash;he would decline to act in so doubtful a
      case. He would float passively down the tide of events&mdash;he would
      neither desert her, nor disobey his mother; he would take everything as it
      came, and to begin, as he was there, he would for the present say nothing
      but what he felt, and what he felt was that he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her so accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, concealing her satisfaction, "that, if he liked her, he would
      not have refused to eat when she asked him."
    </p>
    <p>
      But our hero's appetite had returned with his change of purpose, and he
      instantly volunteered to give the required proof of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly two pound of steaks fell before him. Poor boy, he had hardly
      eaten a genuine meal for a week past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie sat opposite him, and every time he looked off his plate he saw
      her rich blue eyes dwelling on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything contributed to warm his heart, he yielded to the spell, he
      became contented, happy, gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker ginger-cordialed him, his sister bewitched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She related the day's events in a merry mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gatty burst forth into singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sung two light and somber trifles, such as in the present day are
      deemed generally encouraging to spirits, and particularly in accordance
      with the sentiment of supper&mdash;they were about Death and Ivy Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog's voice was not very powerful, but sweet and round as honey
      dropping from the comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      His two hearers were entranced, for the creature sang with an inspiration
      good singers dare not indulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He concluded by informing Christie that the ivy was symbolical of her, and
      the oak prefigured Charles Gatty, Esq.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have inverted the simile with more truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he never said a word to Christie about parting with her, but
      several about being buried in the same grave with her, sixty years hence,
      for which the spot he selected was Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And away he went, leaving golden opinions behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Christie was so affected with his conduct, coming as it did
      after an apparent coolness, that she conquered her bashfulness and called
      on the "vile count," and with some blushes and hesitation inquired,
      "Whether a painter lad was a fit subject of charity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" said his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him Gatty's case, and he instantly promised to see that artist's
      pictures, particularly an "awfu' bonny ane;" the hero of which she
      described as an English minister blessing the bairns with one hand, and
      giving orders to kill the puir Scoetch with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "C'est e'gal," said Christie in Scotch, "it's awfu' bonny."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty reached home late; his mother had retired to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next morning she drew from him what had happened, and then ensued
      another of those dialogues which I am ashamed again to give the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffice it to say, that she once more prevailed, though with far greater
      difficulty; time was to be given him to unsew a connection which he could
      not cut asunder, and he, with tearful eyes and a heavy heart, agreed to
      take some step the very first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This concession was hardly out of his mouth, ere his mother made him kneel
      down and bestowed her blessing upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received it coldly and dully, and expressed a languid hope it might
      prove a charm to save him from despair; and sad, bitter, and dejected,
      forced himself to sit down and work on the picture that was to meet his
      unrelenting creditor's demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was working on his picture, and his mother, with her needle, at the
      table, when a knock was heard, and gay as a lark, and fresh as the dew on
      the shamrock, Christie Johnstone stood in person in the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was evidently the bearer of good tidings; but, before she could
      express them, Mrs. Gatty beckoned her son aside, and announcing, "she
      should be within hearing," bade him take the occasion that so happily
      presented itself, and make the first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time, Christie, who had learned from Jean the arrival of Mrs.
      Gatty, would have been struck with the old lady's silence; but she came to
      tell the depressed painter that the charitable viscount was about to visit
      him and his picture; and she was so full of the good fortune likely to
      ensue, that she was neglectful of minor considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that certain interruptions prevented her from
      ever delivering herself of the news in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, Gatty himself came to her, and, casting uneasy glances at the door
      by which his mother had just gone out, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to paint your likeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was for a <i>souvenir,</i> poor fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! I wad like fine to be painted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be exactly the same size as yourself, and so like you, that,
      should we be parted, I may seem not to be quite alone in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he was obliged to turn his head away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we'll no pairt," replied Christie, cheerfully. "Suppose ye're puir,
      I'm rich, and it's a' one; dinna be so cast down for auchty pund."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, a slipshod servant entered, and said: "There's a fisher lad,
      inquiring for Christie Johnstone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be Flucker," said Christie; "show him ben. What's wrang the noo I
      wonder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The baddish boy entered, took up a position and remained apparently
      passive, hands in pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Aweel, what est?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Custy."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "What's your will, my manny?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Custy, I was at Inch Keith the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "And hae ye really come to Edinbro' to tell me thaat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker (dryly).</i> "Oh! ye ken the lasses are a hantle wiser than we
      are&mdash;will ye hear me? South Inch Keith, I played a bowl i' the water,
      just for divairsion&mdash;and I catched twarree fish!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Floonders, I bet."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Does floonders swim high? I'll let you see his gills, and
      if ye are a reicht fishwife ye'll smell bluid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he opened his jacket, and showed a bright little fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment all Christie's nonchalance gave way to a fiery animation. She
      darted to Flucker's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye hae na been sae daft as tell?" asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker shook his head contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ony birds at the island, Flucker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sea-maws, plenty, and a bird I dinna ken; he moonted sae high, then doon
      like thunder intil the sea, and gart the water flee as high as Haman, and
      porpoises as big as my boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Porr-poises, fulish laddy&mdash;ye hae seen the herrin whale at his wark,
      and the solant guse ye hae seen her at wark; and beneath the sea, Flucker,
      every coedflsh and doegfish, and fish that has teeth, is after them; and
      half Scotland wad be at Inch Keith Island if they kenned what ye hae
      tell't me&mdash;dinna speak to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this, Gatty, who did not comprehend this sudden excitement, or
      thought it childish, had tried in vain to win her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said, a little peevishly, "Will you not attend to me, and tell
      me at least when you will sit to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Set!" cried she. "When there's nae wark to be done stanning."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs, she said to her brother:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Puir lad! I'll sune draw auchty punds fra' the sea for him, with my
      feyther's nets."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she disappeared, Mrs. Gatty appeared. "And this is the woman whose mind
      was not in her dirty business," cried she. "Does not that open your eyes,
      Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Charles," added she, tenderly, "there's no friend like a mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      And off she carried the prize&mdash;his vanity had been mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so that happened to Christie Johnstone which has befallen many a woman&mdash;the
      greatness of her love made that love appear small to her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! mother," cried he, "I must live for you and my art; I am not so dear
      to her as I thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, with a sad heart, he turned away from her; while she, with a light
      heart, darted away to think and act for him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was some two hours after this that a gentleman, plainly dressed, but
      whose clothes seemed a part of himself (whereas mine I have observed hang
      upon me; and the Rev. Josiah Splitall's stick to him)&mdash;glided into
      the painter's room, with an inquiry whether he had not a picture or two
      disposable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have one finished picture, sir," said the poor boy; "but the price is
      high!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought it, in a faint-hearted way; for he had shown it to five
      picture-dealers, and all five agreed it was hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had painted a lime-tree, distant fifty yards, and so painted it that it
      looked something like a lime-tree fifty yards off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was <i>mesquin,"</i> said his judges; "the poetry of painting
      required abstract trees, at metaphysical distance, not the various trees
      of nature, as they appear under positive accidents."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this Mr. Gatty had deluged them with words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When it is art, truth, or sense to fuse a cow, a horse, and a critic into
      one undistinguishable quadruped, with six legs, then it will be art to
      melt an ash, an elm, and a lime, things that differ more than quadrupeds,
      into what you call abstract trees, that any man who has seen a tree, as
      well as looked at one, would call drunken stinging-nettles. You, who never
      look at nature, how can you judge the arts, which are all but copies of
      nature? At two hundred yards' distance, full-grown trees are more
      distinguishable than the animal tribe. Paint me an abstract human being,
      neither man nor a woman," said he, "and then I will agree to paint a tree
      that shall be no tree; and, if no man will buy it, perhaps the father of
      lies will take it off my hands, and hang it in the only place it would not
      disgrace."
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he never left off till he had crushed the non-buyers with
      eloquence and satire; but he could not crush them into buyers&mdash;they
      beat him at the passive retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Gatty, when the momentary excitement of argument had subsided, drank
      the bitter cup all must drink awhile, whose bark is alive and strong
      enough to stem the current down which the dead, weak things of the world
      are drifting, many of them into safe harbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he brought out his picture with a heavy heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said he to himself, "this gentleman will talk me dead, and leave me
      no richer in coin, and poorer in time and patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture was placed in a light, the visitor sat down before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long pause ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he fainted?" thought Gatty, ironically; "he doesn't gabble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do not mind painting before me," said the visitor, "I should be
      glad if you would continue while I look into this picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty painted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor held his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the silence made the artist uneasy, but by degrees it began to
      give him pleasure; whoever this was, it was not one of the flies that had
      hitherto stung him, nor the jackdaws that had chattered him dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious silence! he began to paint under its influence like one inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour passed thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the price of this work of art?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eighty pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it," said his visitor, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, no more difficulty than that? He felt almost disappointed at gaining
      his object so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am obliged to you, sir; much obliged to you," he added, for he
      reflected what eighty pounds were to him just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my descendants who are obliged to you," replied the gentleman; "the
      picture is immortal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were an epoch in the painter's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grave, silent inspection that had preceded them, the cool, deliberate,
      masterly tone in which they were said, made them oracular to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words of such import took him by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had thirsted for average praise in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand had taken him, and placed him at the top of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retired abruptly, or he would have burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said he, "I am a painter; I always thought so at bottom, but I
      suppose it is the height of my ideas makes me discontented with my work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a critic in my room. I had no idea there was a critic in the
      creation, and there is one in my room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he bought your picture, my poor boy?" said Mrs. Gatty, distrustfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her surprise he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! he has got it; only eighty pounds for an immortal picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gatty was overjoyed, Gatty was a little sad; but, reviving, he
      professed himself glad; the picture was going to a judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not much money," said he, "but the man has spoken words that are
      ten thousand pounds to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the room; his visitor, hat in hand, was about to go; a few
      words were spoken about the art of painting, this led to a conversation,
      and then to a short discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer soon showed Mr. Charles Gatty his ignorance of facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man had sat quietly before a multitude of great pictures, new and
      old, in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cooled down Charles Gatty, Esq., monopolist of nature and truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quoted to him thirty painters in Germany, who paint every stroke of a
      landscape in the open air, and forty in various nations who had done it in
      times past.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, sir," he went on, "appear to hang on the skirts of a certain clique,
      who handle the brush well, but draw ill, and look at nature through the
      spectacles of certain ignorant painters who spoiled canvas four hundred
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go no further in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those boys, like all quacks, have one great truth which they disfigure
      with more than one falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold fast their truth, which is a truth the world has always possessed,
      though its practice has been confined to the honest and laborious few.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eschew their want of mind and taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shrink with horror from that profane <i>culte de laideur,</i> that 'love
      of the lopsided,' they have recovered from the foul receptacles of decayed
      art."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reminded him further, that "Art is not imitation, but illusion; that a
      plumber and glazier of our day and a medieval painter are more alike than
      any two representatives of general styles that can be found; and for the
      same reason, namely, that with each of these art is in its infancy; these
      two sets of bunglers have not learned how to produce the illusions of
      art."
    </p>
    <p>
      To all this he added a few words of compliment on the mind, as well as
      mechanical dexterity, of the purchased picture, bade him good morning, and
      glided away like a passing sunbeam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mother's blessing is a great thing to have, and to deserve," said Mrs.
      Gatty, who had rejoined her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, indeed," said Charles. He could not help being struck by the
      coincidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made a sacrifice to his mother, and in a few hours one of his
      troubles had melted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these reflections arrived Mr. Saunders with a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note contained a check for one hundred and fifty pounds, with these
      lines, in which the writer excused himself for the amendment: "I am a
      painter myself," said he, "and it is impossible that eighty pounds can
      remunerate the time expended on this picture, to say nothing of the
      skill."
    </p>
    <p>
      We have treated this poor boy's picture hitherto with just contempt, but
      now that it is gone into a famous collection, mind, we always admired it;
      we always said so, we take our oath we did; if we have hitherto deferred
      framing it, that was merely because it was not sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. GATTY'S PICTURE, AT PRESENT IN THE COLLECTION OF LORD IPSDEN!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, hundreds of years ago, a certain Bishop of Durham, who used to
      fight in person against the Scotch, and defeat them. When he was not with
      his flock, the northern wolves sometimes scattered it; but when the holy
      father was there with his prayers and his battle-ax, England won the day!
    </p>
    <p>
      This nettled the Scottish king, so he penetrated one day, with a large
      band, as far as Durham itself, and for a short time blocked the prelate up
      in his stronghold. This was the period of Mr. Gatty's picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whose title was:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Half Church of God, half Tower against the Scot."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the background was the cathedral, on the towers of which paced to and
      fro men in armor, with the western sun glittering thereon. In the center,
      a horse and cart, led by a boy, were carrying a sheaf of arrows, tied with
      a straw band. In part of the foreground was the prelate, in a half suit of
      armor, but bareheaded; he was turning away from the boy to whom his
      sinking hand had indicated his way into the holy castle, and his benignant
      glance rested on a child, whom its mother was holding up for his
      benediction. In the foreground the afternoon beams sprinkled gold on a
      long grassy slope, corresponding to the elevation on which the cathedral
      stood, separated by the river Wear from the group; and these calm beauties
      of Nature, with the mother and child, were the peaceful side of this
      twofold story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the dry details. But the soul of its charm no pen can fling on
      paper. For the stately cathedral stood and lived; the little leaves
      slumbered yet lived; and the story floated and lived, in the potable gold
      of summer afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      To look at this painted poem was to feel a thrill of pleasure in bare
      existence; it went through the eyes, where paintings stop, and warmed the
      depths and recesses of the heart with its sunshine and its glorious air.

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "WHAT is in the wind this dark night? Six Newhaven boats and twenty boys
      and hobbledehoys, hired by the Johnstones at half a crown each for a
      night's job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Secret service!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is a smuggling lay," suggested Flucker, "but we shall know all
      in good time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smuggling!" Their countenances fell; they had hoped for something more
      nearly approaching the illegal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe she has fand the herrin'," said a ten-year-old.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! haw! haw!" went the others. "She find the herrin', when there's five
      hundred fishermen after them baith sides the Firrth."
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster was discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the expedition bore no signs of fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six boats sailed at sundown, led by Flucker. He brought to on the
      south side of Inch Keith, and nothing happened for about an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then such boys as were awake saw two great eyes of light coming up from
      Granton; rattle went the chain cable, and Lord Ipsden's cutter swung at
      anchor in four fathom water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand questions to Flucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single puff of tobacco-smoke was his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now crept up a single eye of light from Leith; she came among the
      boats; the boys recognized a crazy old cutter from Leith harbor, with
      Christie Johnstone on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that brown heap on her deck?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mountain of nets&mdash;fifty stout herring-nets."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Tunc manifesta fides.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A yell burst from all the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gaun to tak us to Dunbar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half a crown! ye're no blate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie ordered the boats alongside her cutter, and five nets were
      dropped into each boat, six into Flucker's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depth of the water was given them, and they were instructed to shoot
      their nets so as to keep a fathom and a half above the rocky bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A herring net is simply a wall of meshes twelve feet deep, fifty feet
      long; it sinks to a vertical position by the weight of net twine, and is
      kept from sinking to the bottom of the sea by bladders or corks. These
      nets are tied to one another, and paid out at the stern of the boat. Boat
      and nets drift with the tide; if, therefore, the nets touched the rocks
      they would be torn to pieces, and the fisherman ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this saves the herring&mdash;that fish lies hours and hours at the
      very bottom of the sea like a stone, and the poor fisherman shall drive
      with his nets a yard or two over a square mile of fish, and not catch a
      herring tail; on the other hand, if they rise to play for five minutes, in
      that five minutes they shall fill seven hundred boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock all the boats had shot their nets, and Christie went
      alongside his lordship's cutter; he asked her many questions about herring
      fishery, to which she gave clear answers, derived from her father, who had
      always been what the fishermen call a lucky fisherman; that is, he had
      opened his eyes and judged for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden then gave her blue lights to distribute among the boats, that
      the first which caught herring might signal all hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done, and all was expectation. Eleven o'clock came&mdash;no
      signal from any boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie became anxious. At last she went round to the boats; found the
      boys all asleep except the baddish boy; waked them up, and made them all
      haul in their first net. The nets came in as black as ink, no sign of a
      herring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one opinion; there was no herring at Inch Keith; they had
      not been there this seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Flucker, to whom she came in turn, told her he was going into two
      fathom water, where he would let out the bladders and drop the nets on
      their cursed backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong remonstrance was made by Christie, but the baddish boy insisted
      that he had an equal right in all her nets, and, setting his sail, he ran
      into shoal water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie began to be sorrowful; instead of making money, she was going to
      throw it away, and the ne'er-do-weel Flucker would tear six nets from the
      ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker hauled down his sail, and unstepped his mast in two fathom water;
      but he was not such a fool as to risk his six nets; he devoted one to his
      experiment, and did it well; he let out his bladder line a fathom, so that
      one half his net would literally be higgledy-piggledy with the rocks,
      unless the fish were there <i>en masse.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No long time was required.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes he began to haul in the net; first, the boys hauled in the
      rope, and then the net began to approach the surface. Flucker looked
      anxiously down, the other lads incredulously; suddenly they all gave a
      yell of triumph&mdash;an appearance of silver and lightning mixed had
      glanced up from the bottom; in came the first two yards of the net&mdash;there
      were three herrings in it. These three proved Flucker's point as well as
      three million.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hauled in the net. Before they had a quarter of it in, the net came
      up to the surface, and the sea was alive with molten silver. The upper
      half of the net was empty, but the lower half was one solid mass of fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys could not find a mesh, they had nothing to handle but fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the easternmost boat showed a blue light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fish are rising," said Flucker, "we'll na risk nae mair nets."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this a sort of song was heard from the boat that had showed a
      light. Flucker, who had got his net in, ran down to her, and found, as he
      suspected, that the boys had not power to draw the weight of fish over the
      gunwale.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were singing, as sailors do, that they might all pull together; he
      gave them two of his crew, and ran down to his own skipper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The said skipper gave him four men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another blue light!
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie and her crew came a little nearer the boats, and shot twelve
      nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yachtsmen entered the sport with zeal, so did his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boats were all full in a few minutes, and nets still out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Flucker began to fear some of these nets would sink with the weight
      of fish; for the herring die after a while in a net, and a dead herring
      sinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      They got two boats alongside the cutter, and unloaded them into her as
      well as they could; but before they could half do this the other boats
      hailed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to one of them; the boys were struggling with a thing which no
      stranger would have dreamed was a net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a white sheet, fifty feet long, varnished with red-hot silver.
      There were twenty barrels in this single net. By dint of fresh hands they
      got half of her in, and then the meshes began to break; the men leaned
      over the gunwale, and put their arms round blocks and masses of fish, and
      so flung them on board; and the codfish and dogfish snapped them almost
      out of the men's hands like tigers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came to a net which was a double wall of herring; it had been
      some time in the water, and many of the fish were dead; they tried their
      best, but it was impracticable; they laid hold of the solid herring, and
      when they lifted up a hundred-weight clear of the water, away it all tore,
      and sank back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were obliged to cut away this net, with twenty pounds sterling in
      her. They cut away the twine from the head-ropes, and net and fish went to
      the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      All hands were now about the cutter; Christie's nets were all strong and
      new; they had been some time in the water; in hauling them up her side,
      quantities of fish fell out of the net into the water, but there were
      enough left.
    </p>
    <p>
      She averaged twelve barrels a net.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such of the yawls as were not quite full crept between the cutter and the
      nets, and caught all they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The projector of this fortunate speculation suddenly announced that she
      was very sleepy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker rolled her up in a sail, and she slept the sleep of infancy on
      board her cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke it was seven o'clock in the morning, and her cutter was
      creeping with a smart breeze about two miles an hour, a mile from Newhaven
      pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yacht had returned to Granton, and the yawls, very low in the water,
      were creeping along like snails, with both sails set.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was in Edinburgh long before they landed. They had been discerned
      under Inch Keith at the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the manner of their creeping along, when there was such a breeze, told
      the tale at once to the keen, experienced eyes that are sure to be
      scanning the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Donkey-carts came rattling down from the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Merchants came pelting down to Newhaven pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole story began to be put together by bits, and comprehended. Old
      Johnstone's cleverness was recalled to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few fishermen left at Newhaven were ready to kill themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their wives were ready to do the same good office for La Johnstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four Irish merchants agreed to work together, and to make a show of
      competition, the better to keep the price down within bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hardly fair, four men against one innocent unguarded female.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is a wicked world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie landed, and proceeded to her own house; on the way she was met by
      Jean Carnie, who debarrassed her of certain wrappers, and a handkerchief
      she had tied round her head, and informed her she was the pride of
      Newhaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      She next met these four little merchants, one after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      And since we ought to dwell as little as possible upon scenes in which
      unguarded innocence is exposed to artful conspiracies, we will put a page
      or two into the brute form of dramatic dialogue, and so sail through it
      quicker.

      <i>4th Mer.</i> "Are your fish sold? I'll give sixteen shillings."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "I'm seeking twenty-five, an' I'm offered eighteen."

      <i>4th Mer.</i> "Take it." <i>[Exit.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "They hae putten their heads thegither."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Flucker came up to her, and told her there was a Leith merchant
      looking for her. "And, Custy," said he, "there's plenty wind getting up,
      your fish will be sair hashed; put them off your hands, I rede ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Ay, lad! Flucker, hide, an' when I play my hand sae,
      ye'll run in an cry, 'Cirsty, the Irishman will gie ye twenty-two schellin
      the cran.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Flucker.</i> "Ye ken mair than's in the catecheesm, for as releegious
      as ye are."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leith merchant was Mr. Miller, and this is the way he worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miller (in a mellifluous voice).</i> "Are ye no fatigued, my deear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie (affecting fatigue).</i> "Indeed, sir, and I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miller.</i> "Shall I have the pleasure to deal wi' ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "If it's your pleasure, sir. I'm seekin' twenty-five
      schellin."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Miller (pretending not to hear).</i> "As you are a beginner, I must
      offer fair; twenty schellin you shall have, and that's three shillings
      above Dunbar."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Wad ye even carted herrin with my fish caller fra' the
      sea? and Dunbar&mdash;oh, fine! ye ken there's nae herrin at Dunbar the
      morn; this is the Dunbar schule that slipped westward. I'm the matirket,
      ye'll hae to buy o' me or gang to your bed" <i>(here she signaled to
      Flucker).</i> "I'll no be oot o' mine lang."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Enter Flucker hastily, crying:</i> "Cirsty, the Irishman will gie ye
      twenty-two schellin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll no tak it," said Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are keen to hae them," said Flucker; and hastily retired, as if to
      treat further with the small merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this, Mr. Miller, pretending to make for Leith, said, carelessly,
      "Twenty-three shillings, or they are not for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tak the cutter's freight at a hundre' cran, an' I'm no caring," said
      Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are mine!" said Mr. Miller, very sharply. "How much shall I give you
      the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Auchty pund, sir, if you please&mdash;the lave when you like; I ken ye,
      Mr. Miller."
    </p>
    <p>
      While counting her the notes, the purchaser said slyly to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's more than a hundred cran in the cutter, my woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little, sir," replied the vender; "but, ere I could count them till ye
      by baskets, they would lose seven or eight cran in book,* your gain, my

      "You are a vara intelligent young person," said Mr. Miller, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye had measured them wi' your walking-stick, sir; there's just ae scale
      ye didna wipe off, though ye are a carefu' mon, Mr. Miller; sae I laid the
      bait for ye an' fine ye took it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller took out his snuff-box, and tapping it said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will ye go into partnership with me, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, sir!" was the reply. "When I'm aulder an' ye're younger."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the four merchants, believing it useless to disguise their
      co-operation, returned to see what could be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall give you a guinea a barrel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, ye offered her twenty-two shillings before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That we never did, Mr. Miller."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! haw!" went Flucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie looked down and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eyes met eyes, and without a word spoken all was comprehended and silently
      approved. There was no nonsense uttered about morality in connection with
      dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Miller took an enormous pinch of snuff, and drew for the benefit of
      all present the following inference:
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MILLER'S APOTHEGM.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friends and neighbors! when a man's heed is gray with age and thoucht <i>(pause)</i>
      he's just fit to go to schule to a young lass o' twenty."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain middle-aged fishwife, called Beeny Liston, a tenant of
      Christie Johnstone's; she had not paid her rent for some time, and she had
      not been pressed for it; whether this, or the whisky she was in the habit
      of taking, rankled in her mind, certain it is she had always an ill word
      for her landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now met her, envied her success, and called out in a coarse tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ye're a gallant quean; ye'll be waur than ever the noo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrang, if ye please?" said the Johnstone, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reader, did you ever see two fallow bucks commence a duel?
    </p>
    <p>
      They strut round, eight yards apart, tails up, look carefully another way
      to make the other think it all means nothing, and, being both equally sly,
      their horns come together as if by concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even so commenced this duel of tongues between these two heroines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beeny Liston, looking at everybody but Christie, addressed the natives who
      were congregating thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did ever ye hear o' a decent lass taking the herrin' oot o' the men's
      mooths?&mdash;is yon a woman's pairt, I'm asking ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      On this, Christie, looking carefully at all the others except Beeny,
      inquired with an air of simple curiosity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can onybody tell me wha Liston Carnie's drunken wife is speakin' till? no
      to ony decent lass, though. Na! ye ken she wad na hae th' impudence!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ye ken fine I'm speakin' till yoursel'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the horns clashed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me, woman?" <i>(with admirably acted surprise.)</i> "Oo, ay! it will
      be for the twa years' rent you're awin me. Giest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Beeny Liston.</i> "Ye're just the impudentest girrl i' the toon, an' ye
      hae proved it the day" (her arms akimbo).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie (arms akimbo).</i> "Me, impudent? how daur ye speak against my
      charackter, that's kenned for decency o' baith sides the Firrth."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Beeny (contemptuously).</i> "Oh, ye're sly enough to beguile the men,
      but we ken ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "I'm no sly, and" <i>(drawing near and hissing the words)</i>
      "I'm no like the woman Jean an' I saw in Rose Street, dead drunk on the
      causeway, while her mon was working for her at sea. If ye're no ben your
      hoose in ae minute, I'll say that will gar Liston Carnie fling ye ower the
      pier-head, ye fool-moothed drunken leear&mdash;Scairt!"*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *A local word; a corruption from the French <i>Sortez.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      If my reader has seen and heard Mademoiselle Rachel utter her famous <i>Sortez,</i>
      in "Virginie," he knows exactly with what a gesture and tone the Johnstone
      uttered this word.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Beeny (in a voice of whining surprise).</i> "Hech! what a spite Flucker
      Johnstone's dochter has taen against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Scairt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Beeny (in a coaxing voice, and moving a step).</i> "Aweel! what's a'
      your paession, my boenny woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Christie.</i> "Scairt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Beeny retired before the thunder and lightning of indignant virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all the fishboys struck up a dismal chant of victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yoo-hoo&mdash;Custy's won the day&mdash;Beeny's scair<i>tit,"</i> going
      up on the last syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie moved slowly away toward her own house, but before she could
      reach the door she began to whimper&mdash;little fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereat chorus of young Athenians chanted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yu-hoo! come back, Beeny, ye'll maybe win yet. Custy's away gree<i>tin"</i>
      <i>(going up on the last syllable).</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm no greetin, ye rude bairns," said Christie, bursting into tears, and
      retiring as soon as she had effected that proof of her philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about four hours later; Christie had snatched some repose. The
      wind, as Flucker prognosticated, had grown into a very heavy gale, and the
      Firth was brown and boiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a clamor was heard on the shore, and soon after a fishwife made
      her appearance, with rather a singular burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, ladies; <i>rien que cela.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She had him by the scruff of the neck; he was <i>dos-'a-dos,</i> with his
      booted legs kicking in the air, and his fists making warlike but idle
      demonstrations and his mouth uttering ineffectual bad language.
    </p>
    <p>
      This worthy had been called a coward by Sandy Liston, and being about to
      fight with him, and get thrashed, his wife had whipped him up and carried
      him away; she now flung him down, at some risk of his equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye are not fit to feicht wi' Sandy Liston," said she; "if ye are for
      feichtin, here's for ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a comment to this proposal, she tucked up the sleeves of her short
      gown. He tried to run by her; she caught him by the bosom, and gave him a
      violent push, that sent him several paces backward; he looked half fierce,
      half astounded; ere he could quite recover himself, his little servant
      forced a pipe into his hand, and he smoked contented and peaceable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before tobacco the evil passions fall, they tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause of this quarrel soon explained itself; up came Sandy Liston,
      cursing and swearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! ye hae gotten till your wife's; that's the place for ye; to say
      there's a brig in distress, and ye'll let her go on the rocks under your
      noses. But what are ye afraid o'? there's na danger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nae danger!" said one of the reproached, "are ye fou?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye are fou wi' fear yoursel'; of a' the beasts that crawl the airth, a
      cooward is the ugliest, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wifes will no let us," said one, sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the woman in your hairts that keeps ye," roared Sandy hoarsely;
      "curse ye, ye are sure to dee ane day, and ye are sure to be&mdash;&mdash;!"
      (a past participle) "soon or late, what signifies when? Oh! curse the hour
      ever I was born amang sic a cooardly crew." <i>(Gun at sea.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She speaks till ye, hersel'; she cries for maircy; to think that, of a'
      that hear ye cry, Alexander Liston is the only mon mon enough to answer."
      <i>(Gun.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, Mr. Alexander Liston," said a clear, smart voice, whose
      owner had mingled unobserved with the throng; "there are always men to
      answer such occasions; now, my lads, your boats have plenty of beam, and,
      well handled, should live in any sea; who volunteers with Alexander Liston
      and me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was Lord Ipsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fishwives of Newhaven, more accustomed to measure men than poor little
      Lady Barbara Sinclair, saw in this man what in point of fact he was&mdash;a
      cool, daring devil, than whom none more likely to lead men into mortal
      danger, or pull them through it, for that matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They recognized their natural enemy, and collected together against him,
      like hens at the sight of a hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would you really entice our men till their death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My life's worth as much as theirs, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nae! your life! it's na worth a button; when you dee, your next kin will
      dance, and wha'll greet? but our men hae wife and bairns to look till." <i>(Gun
      at sea.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I didn't look at it in that light," said Lord Ipsden. He then
      demanded paper and ink; Christie Johnstone, who had come out of her house,
      supplied it from her treasures, and this cool hand actually began to
      convey a hundred and fifty thousand pounds away, upon a sheet of paper
      blowing in the wind; when he had named his residuary legatee, and disposed
      of certain large bequests, he came to the point&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie Johnstone, what can these people live on? two hundred a year?
      living is cheap here&mdash;confound the wind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twahundred? Fifty! Vile count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call me vile count. I am Ipsden, and my name's Richard. Now, then,
      be smart with your names."
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men stepped forward, gave their names, had their widows provided
      for, and went for their sou'westers, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay," said Lord Ipsden, writing. "To Christina Johnstone, out of respect
      for her character, one thousand pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Richard! dinna gang," cried Christie, "oh, dinna gang, dinna gang, dinna
      gang; it's no your business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you lend me your papa's Flushing jacket and sou'wester, my dear? If
      I was sure to be drowned, I'd go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie ran in for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the mean time, discomposed by the wind, and by feelings whose existence
      neither he, nor I, nor any one suspected, Saunders, after a sore struggle
      between the frail man and the perfect domestic, blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I beg your lordship's pardon, but it blows tempestuous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is why the brig wants us," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I beg your lordship's pardon," whimpered Saunders. "But, oh! my
      lord, don't go; it's all very well for fishermen to be drowned; it is
      their business, but not yours, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saunders, help me on with this coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie had brought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord," said Saunders, briskly, his second nature reviving.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, while putting on the coat and hat, undertook to cool Mr.
      Saunders's aristocratic prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should Alexander Liston and I be drowned," said he, coolly, "when our
      bones come ashore, you will not know which are the fisherman's and which
      the viscount's." So saying, he joined the enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall pray for ye, lad," said Christie Johnstone, and she retired for
      that purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders, with a heavy heart, to the nearest tavern, to prepare an account
      of what he called "Heroism in High Life," large letters, and the usual
      signs of great astonishment!!!!! for the <i>Polytechnic Magazine.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander of the distressed vessel had been penny-wise. He had
      declined a pilot off the Isle of May, trusting to fall in with one close
      to the port of Leith; but a heavy gale and fog had come on; he knew
      himself in the vicinity of dangerous rocks; and, to make matters worse,
      his ship, old and sore battered by a long and stormy voyage, was leaky;
      and unless a pilot came alongside, his fate would be, either to founder,
      or run upon the rocks, where he must expect to go to pieces in a quarter
      of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Newhaven boat lay in comparatively smooth water, on the lee side of
      the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our adventurers got into her, stepped the mast, set a small sail, and ran
      out! Sandy Liston held the sheet, passed once round the belaying-pin, and
      whenever a larger wave than usual came at them, he slacked the sheet, and
      the boat, losing her way, rose gently, like a cork, upon seas that had
      seemed about to swallow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But seen from the shore it was enough to make the most experienced wince;
      so completely was this wooden shell lost to sight, as she descended from a
      wave, that each time her reappearance seemed a return from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was misty&mdash;the boat was soon lost sight of; the story
      remains ashore.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IT was an hour later; the natives of the New Town had left the pier, and
      were about their own doors, when three Buckhaven fishermen came slowly up
      from the pier; these men had arrived in one of their large fishing-boats,
      which defy all weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men came slowly up; their petticoat trousers were drenched, and their
      neck-handkerchiefs and hair were wet with spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the New Town they stood still and whispered to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something about these men that drew the eye of Newhaven upon
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place a Buckhaven man rarely communicates with natives of
      Newhaven, except at the pier, where he brings in his cod and ling from the
      deep sea, flings them out like stones, and sells them to the fishwives;
      then up sail and away for Fifeshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these men evidently came ashore to speak to some one in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      They whispered together; something appeared to be proposed and demurred
      to; but at last two went slowly back toward the pier, and the eldest
      remained, with a fisherman's long mackintosh coat in his hand which the
      others had given him as they left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in his hand, the Buckhaven fisherman stood in an irresolute
      posture; he looked down, and seemed to ask himself what course he should
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrang?" said Jean Carnie, who, with her neighbors, had observed
      the men; "I wish yon man may na hae ill news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ill news wad he hae?" replied another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are ony freends of Liston Carnie here?" said the fisherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wife's awa' to Granton, Beeny Liston they ca' her&mdash;there's his
      house," added Jean, pointing up the row.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," said the fisherman, "I ken he lived there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lived there!" cried Christie Johnstone. "Oh, what's this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freends," said the man, gravely, "his boat is driving keel uppermost in
      Kircauldy Bay. We passed her near enough to read the name upon her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the men will have won to shore, please God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll hae coupit a mile wast Inch Keith, an' the tide rinning aff the
      island an' a heavy sea gaun. This is a' Newhaven we'll see of them" <i>(holding
      up the coat)</i> "till they rise to the top in three weeks' time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man then took the coat, which was now seen to be drenched with water,
      and hung it up on a line not very far from its unfortunate owner's house.
      Then, in the same grave and subdued tone in which he had spoken all along,
      he said, "We are sorry to bring siccan a tale into your toon," and slowly
      moved off to rejoin his comrades, who had waited for him at no great
      distance. They then passed through the Old Town, and in five minutes the
      calamity was known to the whole place.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first stupor, the people in the New Town collected into knots,
      and lamented their hazardous calling, and feared for the lives of those
      that had just put to sea in this fatal gale for the rescue of strangers,
      and the older ones failed not to match this present sorrow with others
      within their recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of this, Flucker Johnstone came hastily in from the Old Town
      and told them he had seen the wife, Beeny Liston, coming through from
      Granton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sympathy of all was instantly turned in this direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She would hear the news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would fall on her like a thunderclap."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would become of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye was strained toward the Old Town, and soon the poor woman was
      seen about to emerge from it; but she was walking in her usual way, and
      they felt she could not carry her person so if she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the last house she was seen to stop and speak to a fisherman and his
      wife that stood at their own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are telling her," was then the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beeny Liston then proceeded on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye was strained.
    </p>
    <p>
      No! they had not told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came gayly on, the unconscious object of every eye and every heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hands of this people were hard, and their tongues rude, but they
      shrunk from telling this poor woman of her bereavement&mdash;they thought
      it kinder she should know it under her own roof, from her friends or
      neighbors, than from comparative strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew near her own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a knot collected round Christie Johnstone, and urged her to
      undertake the sad task.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You that speak sa learned, Christie, ye should tell her; we daur na."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I tell her?" said Christie, turning pale. "How will I tell her?
      I'se try."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took one trembling step to meet the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beeny's eye fell upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! here's the Queen o' Newhaven," cried she, in a loud and rather coarse
      voice. "The men will hae ta leave the place now y' are turned fisherman, I
      daur say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dinna fieicht on me! dinna fieicht on me!" cried Christie, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maircy on us," said the other, "auld Flucker Johnstone's dochter turned
      humble. What next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm vexed for speaking back till ye the morn," faltered Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hett," said the woman carelessly, "let yon flea stick i' the wa'. I fancy
      I began on ye. Aweel, Cirsty," said she, falling into a friendlier tone;
      "it's the place we live in spoils us&mdash;Newhaven's an impudent toon, as
      sure as deeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I passed through the Auld Toon the noo&mdash;a place I never speak in;
      an' if they did na glower at me as I had been a strange beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They cam' to their very doors to glower at me; if ye'll believe me, I
      thoucht shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the hinder end my paassion got up, and I faced a wife East-by, and I
      said, 'What gars ye glower at me that way, ye ignorant woman?' ye would na
      think it, she answered like honey itsel'. 'I'm askin' your paarrdon,' says
      she; and her mon by her side said, 'Gang hame to your ain hoose, my woman,
      and Gude help ye, and help us a' at our need,' the decent mon. 'It's just
      there I'm for,' said I, 'to get my mon his breakfast.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      All who heard her drew their breath with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman then made for her own house, but in going up the street she
      passed the wet coat hanging on the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all trembled&mdash;they had forgotten the coat&mdash;it was all over;
      the coat would tell the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel," said she, "I could sweer that's Liston Carnie's coat, a droukit
      wi' the rain;" then she looked again at it, and added, slowly, "if I did
      na ken he has his away wi' him at the piloting." And in another moment she
      was in her own house, leaving them all standing there half stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie had indeed endeavored to speak, but her tongue had cloven to her
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they stood looking at one another, and at Beeny Liston's door, a
      voice that seemed incredibly rough, loud and harsh, jarred upon them; it
      was Sandy Liston, who came in from Leith, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty pounds for salvage, lasses! is na thaat better than staying
      cooard-like aside the women?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whisht! whisht!" cried Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are in heavy sorrow; puir Liston Cairnie and his son Willy lie deed at
      the bottom o' the Firrth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gude help us!" said Sandy, and his voice sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An', oh, Sandy, the wife does na ken, and it's hairt-breaking to see her,
      and hear her; we canna get her tell't; ye're the auldest mon here; ye'll
      tell her, will ye no, Sandy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, me, that' I will not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; ye are kenned for your stoot heart, an' courage; ye come fra'
      facing the sea an' wind in a bit yawl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sea and the wind," cried he, contemptuously; "they be &mdash;&mdash;,
      I'm used wi' them; but to look a woman i' the face, an' tell her her mon
      and her son are drowned since yestreen, I hae na coorage for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      All further debate was cut short by the entrance of one who came expressly
      to discharge the sad duty all had found so difficult. It was the
      Presbyterian clergyman of the place; he waved them back. "I know, I know,"
      said he, solemnly. "Where is the wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She came out of her house at this moment, as it happened, to purchase
      something at Drysale's shop, which was opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beeny," said the clergyman, "I have sorrowful tidings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me them, sir," said she, unmoved. "Is it a deeth?" added she,
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is!&mdash;death, sudden and terrible; in your own house I must tell it
      you&mdash;(and may God show me how to break it to her)."
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel," said the woman to the others, "it maun be some far-awa cousin, or
      the like, for Liston an' me hae nae near freends. Meg, ye idle fuzzy,"
      screamed she to her servant, who was one of the spectators, "your pat is
      no on yet; div ye think the men will no be hungry when they come in fra'
      the sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will never hunger nor thirst ony mair," said Jean, solemnly, as the
      bereaved woman entered her own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There ensued a listless and fearful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every moment some sign of bitter sorrow was expected to break forth from
      the house, but none came; and amid the expectation and silence the waves
      dashed louder and louder, as it seemed, against the dike, conscious of
      what they had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in a moment, a cry of agony arose, so terrible that all who heard
      it trembled, and more than one woman shrieked in return, and fled from the
      door, at which, the next moment, the clergyman stood alone, collected, but
      pale, and beckoned. Several women advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One woman," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Carnie was admitted; and after a while returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is come to hersel'," whispered she; "I am no weel mysel'." And she
      passed into her own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Flucker crept to the door to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dinna spy on her," cried Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Flucker," said many voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is kneelin'," said Flucker. "He has her hand, to gar her kneel tae&mdash;she
      winna&mdash;she does na see him, nor hear him; he will hae her. He has won
      her to kneel&mdash;he is prayin, an' greetin aside her. I canna see noo,
      my een's blinded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a gude mon," said Christie. "Oh, what wad we do without the
      ministers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy Liston had been leaning sorrowfully against the wall of the next
      house; he now broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "An auld shipmate at the whale-fishing!!! an' noow we'll never lift the
      dredging sang thegither again, in yon dirty detch that's droowned him; I
      maun hae whisky, an' forget it a'."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made for the spirit-shop like a madman; but ere he could reach the door
      a hand was laid on him like a vise. Christie Johnstone had literally
      sprung on him. She hated this horrible vice&mdash;had often checked him;
      and now it seemed so awful a moment for such a sin, that she forgot the
      wild and savage nature of the man, who had struck his own sister, and
      seriously hurt her, a month before&mdash;she saw nothing but the vice and
      its victim, and she seized him by the collar, with a grasp from which he
      in vain attempted to shake himself loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! ye'll no gang there at siccan a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hands off, ye daft jaud," roared he, "or there'll be another deeth i' the
      toon."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the noise Jean Carnie ran in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the ruffian go," cried she, in dismay. "Oh, Christie, dinna put your
      hand on a lion's mane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll put my hand on his mane, ere I'll let him mak a beast o'
      himsel'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sandy, if ye hurt her, I'll find twenty lads that will lay ye deed at her
      feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haud your whisht," said Christie, very sharply, "he's no to be
      threetened."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy Liston, black and white with rage, ground his teeth together, and
      said, lifting his hand, "Wull ye let me go, or must I tak my hand till
      ye?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said Christie, "I'll no let ye go, <i>sae look me i' the face;
      Flucker's dochter, your auld comrade, that saved your life at Holy Isle,
      think o' his face&mdash;an' look in mines&mdash;an' strike me!!!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They glared on one another&mdash;he fiercely and unsteadily; she firmly
      and proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Carnie said afterward, "Her eyes were like coals of fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye are doing what nae mon i' the toon daur; ye are a bauld, unwise
      lassy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's you mak me bauld," was the instant reply. "I saw ye face the mad
      sea, to save a ship fra' the rocks, an' will I fear a mon's hand, when I
      can save" <i>(rising to double her height)</i> "my feyther's auld freend
      fra' the puir mon's enemy, the enemy o' mankind, the cursed, cursed drink?
      Oh, Sandy Liston, hoow could ye think to put an enemy in your mooth to
      steal awa your brains!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This 's no Newhaven chat; wha lairns ye sic words o' power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A deed mon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would na wonder, y' are no canny; she's ta'en a' the poower oot o' my
      body, I think." Then suddenly descending to a tone of abject submission,
      "What's your pleesure, Flucker Johnstone's dochter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She instantly withdrew the offending grasp, and, leaning affectionately on
      his shoulder, she melted into her rich Ionic tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no a time for sin; ye'll sit by my fire, an' get your dinner; a
      bonny haggis hae I for you an' Flucker, an' we'll improve this sorrowfu'
      judgment; an' ye'll tell me o' auld times&mdash;o' my feyther dear, that
      likeit ye weel, Sandy&mdash;o' the storrms ye hae weathered, side by side&mdash;o'
      the muckle whales ye killed Greenland way&mdash;an' abune a', o' the lives
      ye hae saved at sea, by your daurin an' your skell; an', oh, Sandy, will
      na that be better as sit an' poor leequid damnation doown your throat, an'
      gie awa the sense an' feeling o' a mon for a sair heed and an ill name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'se gang, my lamb," said the rough man, quite subdued; "I daur say
      whisky will no pass my teeth the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went quietly away, and sat by Christie's fireside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean and Christie went toward the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, after taking it philosophically for half a minute, began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's wrang?" said Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Div ye think my hairt's no in my mooth wi' you gripping yon fierce
      robber?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a young fishwife, with a box in her hand, who had followed them,
      pulled Jean by the coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hets," said Jean, pulling herself free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child then, with a pertinacity these little animals have, pulled
      Christie's coats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hets," said Christie, freeing herself more gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye suld mairry Van Amburgh," continued Jean; "ye are just such a lass as
      he is a lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie smiled proudly, was silent, but did not disown the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little fishwife, unable to attract attention by pulling, opened her
      box, and saying, "Lasses, I'll let ye see my presoner. Hech! he's boenny!"
      pulled out a mouse by a string fastened to his tail and set him in the
      midst for friendly admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dinna like it&mdash;I dinna like it!" screamed Christie. "Jean, put it
      away&mdash;it fears me, Jean!" This she uttered (her eyes almost starting
      from her head with unaffected terror) at the distance of about eight
      yards, whither she had arrived in two bounds that would have done no
      discredit to an antelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Het," said Jean, uneasily, "hae ye coowed you savage, to be scared at the
      wee beastie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie, looking askant at the animal, explained: "A moose is an awesome
      beast&mdash;it's no like a mon!" and still her eye was fixed by
      fascination upon the four-footed danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, who had not been herself in genuine tranquillity, now turned
      savagely on the little Wombwelless. "An' div ye really think ye are to
      come here wi' a' the beasts i' the Airk? Come, awa ye go, the pair o' ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      These severe words, and a smart push, sent the poor little biped off
      roaring, with the string over her shoulder, recklessly dragging the
      terrific quadruped, which made fruitless grabs at the shingle.&mdash;<i>Moral.</i>
      Don't terrify bigger folk than yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie had intended to go up to Edinburgh with her eighty pounds, but
      there was more trouble in store this eventful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker went out after dinner, and left her with Sandy Liston, who was in
      the middle of a yarn, when some one came running in and told her Flucker
      was at the pier crying for her. She inquired what was the matter. "Come,
      an' ye'll see," was all the answer. She ran down to the pier. There was
      poor Flucker lying on his back; he had slipped from the pier into a boat
      that lay alongside; the fall was considerable; for a minute he had been
      insensible, then he had been dreadfully sick, and now he was beginning to
      feel his hurt; he was in great anguish; nobody knew the extent of his
      injuries; he would let nobody touch him; all his cry was for his sister.
      At last she came; they all made way for her; he was crying for her as she
      came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My bairn! my bairn!" cried she, and the poor little fellow smiled, and
      tried to raise himself toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted him gently in her arms&mdash;she was powerful, and affection
      made her stronger; she carried him in her arms all the way home, and laid
      him on her own bed. Willy Liston, her discarded suitor, ran for the
      surgeon. There were no bones broken, but his ankle was severely sprained,
      and he had a terrible bruise on the loins; his dark, ruddy face was
      streaked and pale; but he never complained after he found himself at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie hovered round him, a ministering angel, applying to him with a
      light and loving hand whatever could ease his pain; and he watched her
      with an expression she had never noticed in his eye before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after two hours' silence, he made her sit in full view, and then
      he spoke to her; and what think you was the subject of his discourse?
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to and told her, one after another, without preface, all the
      loving things she had done to him ever since he was five years old. Poor
      boy, he had never shown much gratitude, but he had forgotten nothing,
      literally nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie was quite overcome with this unexpected trait; she drew him
      gently to her bosom, and wept over him; and it was sweet to see a brother
      and sister treat each other almost like lovers, as these two began to do&mdash;they
      watched each other's eye so tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new care kept the sister in her own house all the next day; but
      toward the evening Jean, who knew her other anxiety, slipped in and
      offered to take her place for an hour by Flucker's side; at the same time
      she looked one of those signals which are too subtle for any but woman to
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie drew her aside, and learned that Gatty and his mother were just
      coming through from Leith; Christie ran for her eighty pounds, placed them
      in her bosom, cast a hasty glance at a looking-glass, little larger than
      an oyster-shell, and ran out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! What pleased the auld wife will be to see he has a lass that can
      mak auchty pund in a morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Christie's notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of them she took out the banknotes, and with eyes glistening and
      cheeks flushing she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Chairles, ye'll no gang to jail&mdash;I hae the siller!" and she
      offered him the money with both hands, and a look of tenderness and
      modesty that embellished human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere he could speak, his mother put out her hand, and not rudely, but very
      coldly, repelling Christie's arm, said in a freezing manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are much obliged to you, but my son's own talents have rescued him
      from his little embarrassment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A nobleman has bought my picture," said Gatty, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For one hundred and fifty pounds," said the old lady, meaning to mark the
      contrast between that sum and what Christie had in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie remained like a statue, with her arms extended, and the
      bank-notes in her hand; her features worked&mdash;she had much ado not to
      cry; and any one that had known the whole story, and seen this unmerited
      repulse, would have felt for her; but her love came to her aid, she put
      the notes in her bosom, sighed and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would hae likeit to hae been the first, ye ken, but I'm real pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mother," said Gatty, "it was very kind of Christie all the same. Oh,
      Christie!" said he, in a tone of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this kind word Christie's fortitude was sore tried; she turned away her
      head; she was far too delicate to let them know who had sent Lord Ipsden
      to buy the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she turned away, Mrs. Gatty said in her son's ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, I have your solemn promise to do it here, and at once; you will find
      me on the beach behind these boats&mdash;do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will understand that during the last few days Mrs. Gatty had
      improved her advantage, and that Charles had positively consented to obey
      her; the poor boy was worn out with the struggle&mdash;he felt he must
      have peace or die; he was thin and pale, and sudden twitches came over
      him; his temperament was not fit for such a battle; and, it is to be
      observed, nearly all the talk was on one side. He had made one expiring
      struggle&mdash;he described to his mother an artist's nature; his
      strength, his weakness&mdash;he besought her not to be a slave to general
      rules, but to inquire what sort of a companion the individual Gatty
      needed; he lashed with true but brilliant satire the sort of wife his
      mother was ready to see him saddled with&mdash;a stupid, unsympathizing
      creature, whose ten children would, by nature's law, be also stupid, and
      so be a weight on him till his dying day. He painted Christie Johnstone,
      mind and body, in words as true and bright as his colors; he showed his
      own weak points, her strong ones, and how the latter would fortify the
      former.
    </p>
    <p>
      He displayed, in short, in one minute, more intellect than his mother had
      exhibited in sixty years; and that done, with all his understanding, wit
      and eloquence, he succumbed like a child to her stronger will&mdash;he
      promised to break with Christie Johnstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Christie had recovered her composure and turned round to her
      companions, she found herself alone with Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chairles," said she, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie," said he, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother does na like me. Oh, ye need na deny it; and we are na
      together as we used to be, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is prejudiced; but she has been the best of mothers to me, Christie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Circumstances compel me to return to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      (Ah, coward! anything but the real truth!)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aweel, Chairles, it will no be for lang."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know; you will not be so unhappy as I shall&mdash;at least I hope
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoow do ye ken that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie, do you remember the first night we danced together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we walked in the cool by the seaside, and I told you the names of the
      stars, and you said those were not their real names, but nicknames we give
      them here on earth. I loved you that first night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I fancied you the first time I set eyes on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I leave you, Christie? What shall I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ken what I shall do," answered Christie coolly; then, bursting into
      tears, she added, "I shall dee! I shall dee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! you must not say so; at least I will never love any one but you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An' I'll live as I am a' my days for your sake. Oh, England! I hae likeit
      ye sae weel, ye suld na rob me o' my lad&mdash;he's a' the joy I hae!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you," said Gatty. "Do you love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      All the answer was, her head upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't do it," thought Gatty, "and I won't! Christie," said he, "stay
      here, don't move from here." And he dashed among the boats in great
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his mother rather near the scene of the late conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said he, fiercely, like a coward as he was, "ask me no more, my
      mind is made up forever; I will not do this scoundrelly, heartless,
      beastly, ungrateful action you have been pushing me to so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, Charles, take care," said the old woman, trembling with
      passion, for this was a new tone for her son to take with her. "You had my
      blessing the other day, and you saw what followed it; do not tempt me to
      curse an undutiful, disobedient, ungrateful son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must take my chance," said he, desperately, "for I am under a curse any
      way! I placed my ring on her finger, and held up my hand to God and swore
      she should be my wife; she has my ring and my oath, and I will not perjure
      myself even for my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ring! Not the ruby ring I gave you from your dead father's finger&mdash;not
      that! not that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! yes! I tell you yes! and if he was alive, and saw her, and knew her
      goodness, he would have pity on me, but I have no friend; you see how ill
      you have made me, but you have no pity; I could not have believed it; but,
      since you have no mercy on me, I will have the more mercy on myself; I
      marry her to-morrow, and put an end to all this shuffling and maneuvering
      against an angel! I am not worthy of her, but I'll marry her to-morrow.
      Good-by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay!" said the old woman, in a terrible voice; "before you destroy me
      and all I have lived for, and suffered, and pinched for, hear me; if that
      ring is not off the hussy's finger in half an hour, and you my son again,
      I fall on this sand and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then God have mercy upon me, for I'll see the whole creation lost
      eternally ere I'll wrong the only creature that is an ornament to the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was desperate; and the weak, driven to desperation, are more furious
      than the strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by Heaven's mercy that neither mother nor son had time to speak
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they faced each other, with flaming eyes and faces, all self-command
      gone, about to utter hasty words, and lay up regret, perhaps for all their
      lives to come, in a moment, as if she had started from the earth, Christie
      Johnstone stood between them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty's words, and, still more, his hesitation, had made her quick
      intelligence suspect. She had resolved to know the truth; the boats
      offered every facility for listening&mdash;she had heard every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood between the mother and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were confused, abashed, and the hot blood began to leave their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood erect like a statue, her cheek pale as ashes, her eyes
      glittering like basilisks, she looked at neither of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly raised her left hand, she withdrew a ruby ring from it, and
      dropped the ring on the sand between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on her heel, and was gone as she had come, without a word
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another, stupefied at first; after a considerable pause
      the stern old woman stooped, picked up the ring, and, in spite of a
      certain chill that the young woman's majestic sorrow had given her, said,
      placing it on her own finger, "This is for your wife!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be for my coffin, then," said her son, so coldly, so bitterly and
      so solemnly that the mother's heart began to quake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said he calmly, "forgive me, and accept your son's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, my son!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are alone in the world now, mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gatty had triumphed, but she felt the price of her triumph more than
      her victory. It had been done in one moment, that for which she had so
      labored, and it seemed that had she spoken long ago to Christie, instead
      of Charles, it could have been done at any moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange to say, for some minutes the mother felt more uneasy than her son;
      she was a woman, after all, and could measure a woman's heart, and she saw
      how deep the wound she had given one she was now compelled to respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles, on the other hand, had been so harassed backward and forward,
      that to him certainty was relief; it was a great matter to be no longer
      called upon to decide. His mother had said, "Part," and now Christie had
      said, "Part"; at least the affair was taken out of his hands, and his
      first feeling was a heavenly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state he continued for about a mile, and he spoke to his mother
      about his art, sole object now; but after the first mile he became silent,
      <i>distrait;</i> Christie's pale face, her mortified air, when her
      generous offer was coldly repulsed, filled him with remorse. Finally,
      unable to bear it, yet not daring to speak, he broke suddenly from his
      mother without a word, and ran wildly back to Newhaven; he looked back
      only once, and there stood his mother, pale, with her hands piteously
      lifted toward heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he got to Newhaven he was as sorry for her as for Christie. He
      ran to the house of the latter; Flucker and Jean told him she was on the
      beach. He ran to the beach! he did not see her at first, but, presently
      looking back, he saw her, at the edge of the boats, in company with a
      gentleman in a boating-dress. He looked&mdash;could he believe his eyes?
      he saw Christie Johnstone kiss this man's hand, who then, taking her head
      gently in his two hands, placed a kiss upon her brow, while she seemed to
      yield lovingly to the caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty turned faint, sick; for a moment everything swam before his eyes; he
      recovered himself, they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He darted round to intercept them; Christie had slipped away somewhere; he
      encountered the man alone!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      CHRISTIE'S situation requires to be explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      On leaving Gatty and his mother, she went to her own house. Flucker&mdash;who
      after looking upon her for years as an inconvenient appendage, except at
      dinnertime, had fallen in love with her in a manner that was half
      pathetic, half laughable, all things considered&mdash;saw by her face she
      had received a blow, and raising himself in the bed, inquired anxiously,
      "What ailed her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At these kind words, Christie Johnstone laid her cheek upon the pillow
      beside Flucker's and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my laamb, be kind to your puir sister fra' this hoor, for she has
      naething i' the warld noo but yoursel'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker began to sob at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie could not cry; her heart was like a lump of lead in her bosom;
      but she put her arm round his neck, and at the sight of his sympathy she
      panted heavily, but could not shed a tear&mdash;she was sore stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Jean came in, and, as the poor girl's head ached as well as her
      heart, they forced her to go and sit in the air. She took her creepie and
      sat, and looked on the sea; but, whether she looked seaward or landward,
      all seemed unreal; not things, but hard pictures of things, some moving,
      some still. Life seemed ended&mdash;she had lost her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour she sat in this miserable trance; she was diverted into a better,
      because a somewhat less dangerous form of grief, by one of those trifling
      circumstances that often penetrate to the human heart when inaccessible to
      greater things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willy the fiddler and his brother came through the town, playing as they
      went, according to custom; their music floated past Christie's ears like
      some drowsy chime, until, all of a sudden, they struck up the old English
      air, "Speed the Plow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was to this tune Charles Gatty had danced with her their first
      dance the night they made acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie listened, lifted up her hands, and crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what will I do? what will I do?" burst into a passion of grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her apron over her head, and rocked herself, and sobbed bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in this situation when Lord Ipsden, who was prowling about,
      examining the proportions of the boats, discovered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one in distress&mdash;that was all in his way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted up her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Christie Johnstone. I'm so glad; that is, I'm sorry you are crying,
      but I'm glad I shall have the pleasure of relieving you;" and his lordship
      began to feel for a check-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And div ye really think siller's a cure for every grief!" said Christie,
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know," said his lordship; "it has cured them all as yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will na cure me, then!" and she covered her head with her apron again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry," said he; "tell me" <i>(whispering),</i> "what is it?
      poor little Christie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinna speak to me; I think shame; ask Jean. Oh, Richard, I'll no be lang
      in this warld!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said he, "I know too well what it is now; I know, by sad experience.
      But, Christie, money will cure it in your case, and it shall, too; only,
      instead of five pounds, we must put a thousand pounds or two to your
      banker's account, and then they will all see your beauty, and run after
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How daur ye even to me that I'm seekin a lad?" cried she, rising from her
      stool; "I would na care suppose there was na a lad in Britain." And off
      she flounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Offended her by my gross want of tact," thought the viscount.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crept back, and two velvet lips touched his hand. That was because she
      had spoken harshly to a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Richard," said she, despairingly, "I'll no be lang in this warld."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was touched; and it was then he took her head and kissed her brow, and
      said: "This will never do. My child, go home and have a nice cry, and I
      will speak to Jean; and, rely upon me, I will not leave the neighborhood
      till I have arranged it all to your satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she went&mdash;a little, a very little, comforted by his tone and
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was all very pretty; but then seen at a distance of fifty yards
      it looked very ugly; and Gatty, who had never before known jealousy, the
      strongest and worst of human passions, was ripe for anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Lord Ipsden, and said at once, in his wise, temperate way:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you are a villain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden. "Plait-il?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "You are a villain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "How do you make that out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "But, of course, you are not a coward, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden (ironically).</i> "You surprise me with your moderation, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "Then you will waive your rank&mdash;you are a lord, I
      believe-and give me satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "My rank, sir, such as it is, engages me to give a proper
      answer to proposals of this sort; I am at your orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "A man of your character must often have been called to an
      account by your victims, so&mdash;so&mdash;" (hesitating) "perhaps you
      will tell me the proper course."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden. "I</i> shall send a note to the castle, and the colonel will
      send me down somebody with a mustache; I shall pretend to remember
      mustache, mustache will pretend he remembers me; he will then communicate
      with your friend, and they will arrange it all for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "And, perhaps, through your licentiousness, one or both of
      us will be killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "Yes! but we need not trouble our heads about that&mdash;the
      seconds undertake everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "I have no pistols."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "If you will do me the honor to use one of mine, it shall
      be at your service."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "To-morrow morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "No. I have four days' painting to do on my picture, I can't
      die till it is finished; Friday morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "(He is mad.) I wish to ask you a question, you will excuse
      my curiosity. Have you any idea what we are agreeing to differ about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Gatty.</i> "The question does you little credit, my lord; that is to
      add insult to wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went off hurriedly, leaving Lord Ipsden mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought Christie Johnstone was somehow connected with it; but,
      conscious of no wrong, he felt little disposed to put up with any insult,
      especially from this boy, to whom he had been kind, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship was, besides, one of those good, simple-minded creatures,
      educated abroad, who, when invited to fight, simply bow, and load two
      pistols, and get themselves called at six; instead of taking down tomes of
      casuistry and puzzling their poor brains to find out whether they are
      gamecocks or capons, and why.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Gatty, he hurried home in a fever of passion, begged his mother's
      pardon, and reproached himself for ever having disobeyed her on account of
      such a perfidious creature as Christie Johnstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then told her what he had seen, as distance and imagination had
      presented it to him; to his surprise the old lady cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles," said she, "there is no need to take the girl's character away;
      she has but one fault&mdash;she is not in the same class of life as you,
      and such marriages always lead to misery; but in other respects she is a
      worthy young woman&mdash;don't speak against her character, or you will
      make my flesh creep; you don't know what her character is to a woman, high
      or low."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this moderation, perhaps she held him still faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday morning arrived. Gatty had, by hard work, finished his picture,
      collected his sketches from nature, which were numerous, left by
      memorandum everything to his mother, and was, or rather felt, as ready to
      die as live.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly spoken a word or eaten a meal these four days; his mother
      was in anxiety about him. He rose early, and went down to Leith; an hour
      later, his mother, finding him gone out, rose and went to seek him at
      Newhaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Flucker had entirely recovered, but his sister's color had left
      her cheeks. The boy swore vengeance against the cause of her distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday morning, then, there paced on Leith Sands two figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was Lord Ipsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other seemed a military gentleman, who having swallowed the mess-room
      poker, and found it insufficient, had added the ramrods of his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more his lordship reflected on Gatty, the less inclined he had felt to
      invite a satirical young dog from barracks to criticise such a <i>rencontre;</i>
      he had therefore ordered Saunders to get up as a field-marshal, or some
      such trifle, and what Saunders would have called incomparable verticality
      was the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter was also in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was coming up, Lord Ipsden was lecturing Marshal Saunders on a
      point on which that worthy had always thought himself very superior to his
      master&mdash;"Gentlemanly deportment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Saunders, mind and behave like a gentleman, or we shall be found
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust, my lord, my conduct&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I mean is, you must not be so overpoweringly gentleman-like as you
      are apt to be; no gentleman is so gentleman as all that; it could not be
      borne, <i>c'est suffoquant;</i> and a white handkerchief is
      unsoldier-like, and nobody ties a white handkerchief so well as that; of
      all the vices, perfection is the most intolerable." His lordship then
      touched with his cane the generalissimo's tie, whose countenance
      straightway fell, as though he had lost three successive battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your second, sir?" said the mare'chal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My second?" said Gatty. "Ah! I forgot to wake him&mdash;does it matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is merely a custom," said Lord Ipsden, with a very slightly satirical
      manner. "Savanadero," said he, "do us the honor to measure the ground, and
      be everybody's second."
    </p>
    <p>
      Savanadero measured the ground, and handed a pistol to each combatant, and
      struck an imposing attitude apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you ready, gentlemen?" said this Jack-o'-both-sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the signal was about to be given, an interruption occurred. "I beg
      your pardon, sir," said Lord Ipsden to his antagonist; "I am going to take
      a <i>liberty&mdash;a great liberty</i> with you, but I think you will find
      your pistol is only at half cock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my lord; what am I to do with the thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Draw back the cock so, and be ready to fire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So?" <i>Bang!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He had touched the trigger as well as the cock, so off went the barker;
      and after a considerable pause the field-marshal sprang yelling into the
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" cried Mr. Gatty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! oh! I'm a dead man," whined the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!" said Ipsden, after a moment of anxiety. "Give yourself no
      concern, sir," said he, soothingly, to his antagonist&mdash;"a mere
      accident. Mare'chal, reload Mr. Gatty's pistol."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, my lord&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Load his pistol directly," said his lordship, sternly; "and behave like a
      gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord! my lord! but where shall I stand to be safe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behind me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander of division advanced reluctantly for Gatty's pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord!" said Gatty, "it is plain I am not a fit antagonist; I shall
      but expose myself&mdash;and my mother has separated us; I have lost her&mdash;if
      you do not win her some worse man may; but, oh! if you are a man, use her
      tenderly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie Johnstone! Oh, sir, do not make her regret me too much! She was
      my treasure, my consolation&mdash;she was to be my wife, she would have
      cheered the road of life&mdash;it is a desert now. I loved her&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the poor fellow choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden turned round, and threw his pistol to Saunders, saying, "Catch
      that, Saunders."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saunders, on the contrary, by a single motion changed his person from a
      vertical straight line to a horizontal line exactly parallel with the
      earth's surface, and the weapon sang innoxious over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship then, with a noble defiance of etiquette, walked up to his
      antagonist and gave him his hand, with a motion no one could resist; for
      he felt for the poor fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all a mistake," said he. "There is no sentiment between La
      Johnstone and me but mutual esteem. I will explain the whole thing. <i>I</i>
      admire <i>her</i> for her virtue, her wit, her innocence, her goodness and
      all that sort of thing; and <i>she,</i> what <i>she</i> sees in <i>me,</i>
      I am sure I don't know," added he, slightly shrugging his aristocratic
      shoulders. "Do me the honor to breakfast with me at Newhaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have ordered twelve sorts of fish at the 'Peacock,' my lord," said
      Saunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divine! (I hate fish) I told Saunders all would be hungry and none shot;
      by the by, you are winged, I think you said, Saunders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord! but look at my trousers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bullet had cut his pantaloons.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see&mdash;only barked; so go and see about our breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord" <i>(faintly).</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "And draw on me for fifty pounds' worth of&mdash;new trousers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord" <i>(sonorously).</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The duelists separated, Gatty taking the short cut to Newhaven; he
      proposed to take his favorite swim there, to refresh himself before
      breakfast; and he went from his lordship a little cheered by remarks which
      fell from him, and which, though vague, sounded friendly&mdash;poor
      fellow, except when he had a brush in hand he was a dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This viscount, who did not seem to trouble his head about class dignity,
      was to convert his mother from her aristocratic tendencies or something.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Que sais-je?</i> what will not a dreamer hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden strolled along the sands, and judge his surprise, when,
      attended by two footmen, he met at that time in the morning Lady Barbara
      Sinclair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden had been so disheartened and piqued by this lady's conduct
      that for a whole week he had not been near her. This line of behavior
      sometimes answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met him with a grand display of cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      She inquired, "Whether he had heard of a most gallant action, that,
      coupled with another circumstance" <i>(here she smiled),</i> "had in part
      reconciled her to the age we live in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked for further particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then informed him "that a ship had been ashore on the rocks, that no
      fisherman dared venture out, that a young gentleman had given them his
      whole fortune, and so bribed them to accompany him; that he had saved the
      ship and the men's lives, paid away his fortune, and lighted an odious
      cigar and gone home, never minding, amid the blessings and acclamations of
      a maritime population."
    </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful story she told him; so beautiful, in fact, that until she had
      discoursed ten minutes he hardly recognized his own feat; but when he did
      he blushed inside as well as out with pleasure. Oh! music of music&mdash;praise
      from eloquent lips, and those lips the lips we love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he felt ashamed; ashamed that Lady Barbara should praise
      him beyond his merits, as he conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a faint hypocritical endeavor to moderate her eulogium; this gave
      matters an unexpected turn, Lady Barbara's eyes flashed defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it was a noble action, that one nursed in effeminacy (as you all
      are) should teach the hardy seamen to mock at peril&mdash;noble fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did a man's duty, Barbara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ipsden, take care, you will make me hate you, if you detract from a deed
      you cannot emulate. This gentleman risked his own life to save others&mdash;he
      is a hero! I should know him by his face the moment I saw him. Oh, that I
      were such a man, or knew where to find such a creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The water came into Lord Ipsden's eyes; he did not know what to say or do;
      he turned away his head. Lady Barbara was surprised; her conscience smote
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear," said she, "there now, I have given you pain&mdash;forgive me;
      we can't all be heroes; dear Ipsden, don't think I despise you now as I
      used. Oh, no! I have heard of your goodness to the poor, and I have more
      experience now. There is nobody I esteem more than you, Richard, so you
      need not look so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, dearest Barbara."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and if you were to be such a goose as to write me another letter
      proposing absurdities to me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would the answer be different?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Barbara, would you accept?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course not; but I would refuse civilly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, don't sigh; I hate a sighing man. I'll tell you something that I
      know will make you laugh." She then smiled saucily in his face, and said,
      "Do you remember Mr.&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>L'effronte'e!</i> this was the earnest man. But Ipsden was a match for
      her this time. "I think I do," said he; "a gentleman who wants to make
      John Bull little again into John Calf; but it won't do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship laughed. "Why did you not tell us that on Inch Coombe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I had not read <i>The Catspaw</i> then."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"The Catspaw?</i> Ah! I thought it could not be you. Whose is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Jerrold's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Mr. Jerrold is cleverer than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is certain! Well, Mr. Jerrold and Lord Ipsden, you will both be glad
      to hear that it was, in point of fact, a bull that confuted the advocate
      of the Middle Ages; we were walking; he was telling me manhood was extinct
      except in a few earnest men who lived upon the past, its associations, its
      truth; when a horrid bull gave&mdash;oh&mdash;such a bellow! and came
      trotting up. I screamed and ran&mdash;I remember nothing but arriving at
      the stile, and lo, on the other side, offering me his arm with <i>empressment</i>
      across the wooden barrier was&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! don't you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;oh&mdash;yes, I see!&mdash;fancy&mdash;ah! Shall I tell you how
      he came to get first over? He ran more earnestly than you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not Mr. Jerrold this time, I presume," said her satirical ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! you cannot always have him. I venture to predict your ladyship on
      your return home gave this mediaeval personage his <i>conge'."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave it him at the stile! Let us be serious, if you please; I have a
      confidence to make you, Ipsden. Frankly, I owe you some apology for my
      conduct of late; I meant to be reserved&mdash;I have been rude&mdash;but
      you shall judge me. A year ago you made me some proposals; I rejected them
      because, though I like you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You like me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I detest your character. Since then, my West India estate has been turned
      into specie; that specie, the bulk of my fortune, placed on board a
      vessel; that vessel lost, at least we think so&mdash;she has not been
      heard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear cousin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you comprehend that now I am cooler than ever to all young gentlemen
      who have large incomes, and" (holding out her hand like an angel) "I must
      trouble you to forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her lovely hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I esteem you more and more," said he. "You ought, for it has been a hard
      struggle to me not to adore you, because you are so improved, <i>mon
      cousin."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible? In what respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are browner and charitabler; and I should have been very kind to you&mdash;mawkishly
      kind, I fear, my sweet cousin, if this wretched money had not gone down in
      the <i>Tisbe."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!" cried the viscount.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" squeaked Lady Barbara, unused to such interjections.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone down in what?" said Ipsden, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't bellow in people's ears. The <i>Tisbe,</i> stupid," cried she,
      screaming at the top of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ri tum, ti turn, ti tum, tum, tum, tiddy, iddy," went Lord Ipsden&mdash;he
      whistled a polka.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barbara (inspecting him gravely).</i> "I have heard it at a
      distance, but I never saw how it was done before. <i>It is very, very
      pretty!!!!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden. "Polkez-vous, madame?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barb. "Si, je polke, Monsieur le Vicomte."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      They polked for a second or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I dare say I am wrong," cried Lady Barbara, "but I like you better
      now you are a downright&mdash;ahem!&mdash;than when you were only an
      insipid non-intellectual&mdash;you are greatly improved."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ips.</i> "In what respects?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barb.</i> "Did I not tell you? browner and more impudent; but tell
      me," said she, resuming her sly, satirical tone, "how is it that you, who
      used to be the pink of courtesy, dance and sing over the wreck of my
      fortunes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they are not wrecked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I told you my specie is gone down in the <i>Tisbe."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "But the <i>Tisbe</i> has not gone down."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barb.</i> "I tell you it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "I assure you it is not."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barb.</i> "It is not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "Barbara! I am too happy, I begin to nourish such sweet
      hopes once more. Oh, I could fall on my knees and bless you for something
      you said just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Barbara blushed to the temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why don't you?" said she. "All you want is a little enthusiasm."
      Then recovering herself, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You kneel on wet sand, with black trousers on; that will never be!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These two were so occupied that they did not observe the approach of a
      stranger until he broke in upon their dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Ancient Mariner had been for some minutes standing off and on,
      reconnoitering Lord Ipsden; he now bore down, and with great rough,
      roaring cordiality, that made Lady Barbara start, cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your hand, sir&mdash;give me your hand, if you were twice a lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't speak to you till the brig was safe in port, and you slipped
      away, but I've brought you up at last; and&mdash;give me your hand again,
      sir. I say, isn't it a pity you are a lord instead of a sailor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "But I am a sailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ancient Mariner.</i> "That ye are, and as smart a one as ever tied a
      true-lover's knot in the top; but tell the truth&mdash;you were never
      nearer losing the number of your mess than that day in the old <i>Tisbe."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barb.</i> "The old <i>Tisbe!</i> Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "Do you remember that nice little lurch she gave to leeward
      as we brought her round?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lady Barb.</i> "Oh, Richard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ancient Mariner.</i> "And that reel the old wench gave under our feet,
      north the pier-head. I wouldn't have given a washing-tub for her at that
      moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ipsden.</i> "Past danger becomes pleasure, sir. <i>Olim et hoec
      meminisse</i>&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ancient Mariner (taking off his hat with feeling).</i> "God bless ye,
      sir, and send ye many happy days, and well spent, with the pretty lady I
      see alongside; asking your pardon, miss, for parting pleasanter company&mdash;so
      I'll sheer off."
    </p>
    <p>
      And away went the skipper of the <i>Tisbe,</i> rolling fearfully. In the
      heat of this reminiscence, the skipper of the yacht (they are all alike,
      blue water once fairly tasted) had lost sight of Lady Barbara; he now
      looked round. Imagine his surprise!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship was in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Barbara," said Lord Ipsden, "do not distress yourself on my
      account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not your fe-feelings I care about; at least, I h-h-hope not; but I
      have been so unjust, and I prided myself so on my j-ju-justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if you don't, I don't. I hate myself, so it is no wonder you h-hate
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you more than ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are a good soul! Of course you know I always&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;esteemed
      you, Richard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I had an idea you despised me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How silly you are! Can't you see? When I thought you were not perfection,
      which you are now, it vexed me to death; you never saw me affront any one
      but you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I never did! What does that prove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends upon the wit of him that reasons thereon." (Coming to
      herself.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love you, Barbara! Will you honor me with your hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I am not so base, so selfish. You are worth a hundred of me, and here
      have I been treating you <i>de haut en bas.</i> Dear Richard, poor
      Richard. Oh! oh! oh!" (A perfect flood of tears.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barbara! I regret nothing; this moment pays for all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, I will! since you keep pressing me. There, let me go; I must
      be alone; I must tell the sea how unjust I was, and how happy I am, and
      when you see me again you shall see the better side of your cousin
      Barbara."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was peremptory. "She had her folly and his merits to think over," she
      said; but she promised to pass through Newhaven, and he should put her
      into her pony-phaeton, which would meet her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Barbara was only a fool by the excess of her wit over her experience;
      and Lord Ipsden's love was not misplaced, for she had a great heart which
      she hid from little people. I forgive her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolutions she formed in company with the sea, having dismissed
      Ipsden, and ordered her flunky into the horizon, will probably give our
      viscount just half a century of conjugal bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was going she stopped him and said: "Your friend had browner hands
      than I have hitherto conceived possible. <i>To tell the truth,</i> I took
      them for the claws of a mahogany table when he grappled you&mdash;is that
      the term? <i>C'est e'gal</i>&mdash;I like him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him again. "Ipsden, in the midst of all this that poor man's
      ship is broken. I feel it is! You will buy him another, if you really love
      me&mdash;for I like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so these lovers parted for a time; and Lord Ipsden with a bounding
      heart returned to Newhaven. He went to entertain his late <i>vis-'a-vis</i>
      at the "Peacock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime a shorter and less pleasant <i>rencontre</i> had taken place
      between Leith and that village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty felt he should meet his lost sweetheart; and sure enough, at a turn
      of the road Christie and Jean came suddenly upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded, but Christie took no notice of him; they passed him; he
      turned and followed them, and said, "Christie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your will wi' me?" said she, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;How pale you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am no very weel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has been watching over muckle wi' Flucker," said Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie thanked her with a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it is not&mdash;not&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nae fears, lad," said she, briskly; "I dinna think that muckle o' ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I think of nothing but you," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep flush crimsoned the young woman's brow, but she restrained herself,
      and said icily: "Thaat's very gude o' ye, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gatty felt all the contempt her manners and words expressed. He bit his
      lips. The tear started to his eye. "You will forget me," said he. "I do
      not deserve to be remembered, but I shall never forget you. I leave for
      England. I leave Newhaven forever, where I have been so happy. I am going
      at three o'clock by the steamboat. Won't you bid me good-by?" He
      approached her timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! that wull do," cried she; "Gude be wi' ye, lad; I wish ye nae ill."
      She gave a commanding gesture of dismissal; he turned away, and went sadly
      from her. She watched every motion when his back was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is you, Christie," said Jean; "use the lads like dirt, an' they
      think a' the mair o' ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jean, my hairt's broken. I'm just deeing for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me speak till him then," said Jean; "I'll sune bring him till his
      marrow-banes;" and she took a hasty step to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie held her fast. "I'd dee ere I'd give in till them. Oh, Jean! I'm
      a lassie clean flung awa; he has neither hairt nor spunk ava, yon lad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean began to make excuses for him. Christie inveighed against him. Jean
      spoke up for him with more earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now observe, Jean despised the poor boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie adored him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jean spoke for him, because women of every degree are often one solid
      mass of tact; and Christie abused him, because she wanted to hear him
      defended.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      RICHARD, LORD VISCOUNT IPSDEN, having dotted the seashore with sentinels,
      to tell him of Lady Barbara's approach, awaited his guest in the
      "Peacock"; but, as Gatty was a little behind time, he placed Saunders
      sentinel over the "Peacock," and strolled eastward; as he came out of the
      "Peacock," Mrs. Gatty came down the little hill in front, and also
      proceeded eastward; meantime Lady Barbara and her escort were not far from
      the New Town of Newhaven, on their way from Leith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gatty came down, merely with a vague fear. She had no reason to
      suppose her son's alliance with Christie either would or could be renewed,
      but she was a careful player and would not give a chance away; she found
      he was gone out unusually early, so she came straight to the only place
      she dreaded; it was her son's last day in Scotland. She had packed his
      clothes, and he had inspired her with confidence by arranging pictures,
      etc., himself; she had no idea he was packing for his departure from this
      life, not Edinburgh only.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came then to Newhaven with no serious misgivings, for, even if her son
      had again vacillated, she saw that, with Christie's pride and her own
      firmness, the game must be hers in the end; but, as I said before, she was
      one who played her cards closely, and such seldom lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my story is with the two young fishwives, who, on their return from
      Leith, found themselves at the foot of the New Town, Newhaven, some
      minutes before any of the other persons who, it is to be observed, were
      approaching it from different points; they came slowly in, Christie in
      particular, with a listlessness she had never, known till this last week;
      for some days her strength had failed her&mdash;it was Jean that carried
      the creel now&mdash;before, Christie, in the pride of her strength, would
      always do more than her share of their joint labor. Then she could hardly
      be forced to eat, and what she did eat was quite tasteless to her, and
      sleep left her, and in its stead came uneasy slumbers, from which she
      awoke quivering from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! perilous venture of those who love one object with the whole heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great but tender heart was breaking day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Christie and Jean, strolling slowly into the New Town of Newhaven,
      found an assemblage of the natives all looking seaward; the fishermen,
      except Sandy Liston, were away at the herring fishery, but all the boys
      and women of the New Town were collected; the girls felt a momentary
      curiosity; it proved, however, to be only an individual swimming in toward
      shore from a greater distance than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little matter excites curiosity in such places.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's head looked like a spot of ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy Liston was minding his own business, lazily mending a skait-net,
      which he had attached to a crazy old herring-boat hauled up to rot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie sat down, pale and languid, by him, on a creepie that a lass who
      had been baiting a line with mussels had just vacated; suddenly she seized
      Jean's arm with a convulsive motion; Jean looked up&mdash;it was the
      London steamboat running out from Leith to Granton Pier to take up her
      passengers for London. Charles Gatty was going by that boat; the look of
      mute despair the poor girl gave went to Jean's heart; she ran hastily from
      the group, and cried out of sight for poor Christie.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fishwife, looking through a telescope at the swimmer, remarked: "He's
      coming in fast; he's a gallant swimmer, yon&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can he dee't?" inquired Christie of Sandy Liston.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine thaat," was the reply; "he does it aye o' Sundays when ye are at the
      kirk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no oot o' the kirk window ye'll hae seen him, Sandy, my mon," said a
      young fishwife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rin for my glass ony way, Flucker," said Christie, forcing herself to
      take some little interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker brought it to her, she put her hand on his shoulder, got slowly
      up, and stood on the creepie and adjusted the focus of her glass; after a
      short view, she said to Flucker:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rin and see the nook." She then leveled her glass again at the swimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker informed her the nook said "half eleven"&mdash;Scotch for "half
      past ten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie whipped out a well-thumbed almanac.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yon nook's aye ahint," said she. She swept the sea once more with her
      glass, then brought it together with a click, and jumped off the stool.
      Her quick intelligence viewed the matter differently from all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noow," cried she, smartly, "wha'll lend me his yawl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hets! dinna be sae interferin', lassie," said a fishwife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hae nane o' ye ony spunk?" said Christie, taking no notice of the woman.
      "Speak, laddies!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M' uncle's yawl is at the pier-head; ye'll get her, my woman," said a
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A schell'n for wha's first on board," said Christie, holding up the coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come awa', Flucker, we'll hae her schell'n;" and these two worthies
      instantly effected a false start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no under your jackets," said Christie, as she dashed after them like
      the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haw! haw! haw!" laughed Sandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's her business picking up a mon against his will?" said a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's an awfu' lassie," whined another. The examination of the swimmer
      was then continued, and the crowd increased; some would have it he was
      rapidly approaching, others that he made little or no way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wha est?" said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a lummy," said a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Na! it's no a lummy," said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie's boat was now seen standing out from the pier. Sandy Liston,
      casting a contemptuous look on all the rest, lifted himself lazily into
      the herring-boat and looked seaward. His manner changed in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Deevil!" cried he; "the tide's turned! You wi' your glass, could you
      no see yon man's drifting oot to sea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech!" cried the women, "he'll be drooned&mdash;he'll be drooned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he'll be drooned!" cried Sandy, "if yon lassie does na come
      alongside him deevelich quick&mdash;he's sair spent, I doot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two spectators were now added to the scene, Mrs. Gatty and Lord Ipsden.
      Mrs. Gatty inquired what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a mon drooning," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow, whom Sandy, by aid of his glass, now discovered to be in
      a wornout condition, was about half a mile east of Newhaven pier-head, and
      unfortunately the wind was nearly due east. Christie was standing
      north-northeast, her boat-hook jammed against the sail, which stood as
      flat as a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives of the Old Town were now seen pouring down to the pier and the
      beach, and strangers were collecting like bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After wit is everybody's wit!!!"&mdash;<i>Old Proverb.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair was in the Johnstone's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That boat is not going to the poor man," said Mrs. Gatty, "it is turning
      its back upon him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She canna lie in the wind's eye, for as clever as she is," answered a
      fishwife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ken wha it is," suddenly squeaked a little fishwife; "it's Christie
      Johnstone's lad; it's yon daft painter fr' England. Hech!" cried she,
      suddenly, observing Mrs. Gatty, "it's your son, woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate woman gave a fearful scream, and, flying like a tiger on
      Liston, commanded him "to go straight out to sea and save her son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Carnie seized her arm. "Div ye see yon boat?" cried she; "and div ye
      mind Christie, the lass wha's hairt ye hae broken? aweel, woman&mdash;<i>it's
      just a race between deeth and Cirsty Johnstone for your son.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old woman swooned dead away; they carried her into Christie
      Johnstone's house and laid her down, then hurried back&mdash;the greater
      terror absorbed the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Barbara Sinclair was there from Leith; and, seeing Lord Ipsden
      standing in the boat with a fisherman, she asked him to tell her what it
      was; neither he nor any one answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why doesn't she come about, Liston?" cried Lord Ipsden, stamping with
      anxiety and impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll no be lang," said Sandy; "but they'll mak a mess o' 't wi' ne'er a
      man i' the boat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye're sure o' thaat?" put in a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, about she comes," said Liston, as the sail came down on the first
      tack. He was mistaken; they dipped the lug as cleverly as any man in the
      town could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! look at her hauling on the rope like a mon," cried a woman. The
      sail flew up on the other tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's an awfu' lassie,". whined another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's awa," groaned Liston, "he's doon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! he's up again," cried Lord Ipsden; "but I fear he can't live till the
      boat comes to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisherman and the viscount held on by each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does na see her, or maybe he'd tak hairt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd give ten thousand pounds if only he could see her. My God, the man
      will be drowned under our eyes. If he but saw her!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The words had hardly left Lord Ipsden's lips, when the sound of a woman's
      voice came like an AEolian note across the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurraih!" roared Liston, and every creature joined the cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll no let him dee. Ah! she's in the bows, hailing him an' waving the
      lad's bonnet ower her head to gie him coorage. Gude bless ye, lass; Gude
      bless ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie knew it was no use hailing him against the wind, but the moment
      she got the wind she darted into the bows, and pitched in its highest key
      her full and brilliant voice; after a moment of suspense she received
      proof that she must be heard by him, for on the pier now hung men and
      women, clustered like bees, breathless with anxiety, and the moment after
      she hailed the drowning man, she saw and heard a wild yell of applause
      burst from the pier, and the pier was more distant than the man. She
      snatched Flucker's cap, planted her foot on the gunwale, held on by a
      rope, hailed the poor fellow again, and waved the cap round and round her
      head, to give him courage; and in a moment, at the sight of this,
      thousands of voices thundered back their cheers to her across the water.
      Blow, wind&mdash;spring, boat&mdash;and you, Christie, still ring life
      toward those despairing ears and wave hope to those sinking eyes; cheer
      the boat on, you thousands that look upon this action; hurrah! from the
      pier; hurrah! from the town; hurrah! from the shore; hurrah! now, from the
      very ships in the roads, whose crews are swarming on the yards to look;
      five minutes ago they laughed at you; three thousand eyes and hearts hang
      upon you now; ay, these are the moments we live for!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now dead silence. The boat is within fifty yards, they are all three
      consulting together round the mast; an error now is death; his forehead
      only seems above water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they miss him on that tack?" said Lord Ipsden, significantly, to
      Liston.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll never see London Brigg again," was the whispered reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried on till all on shore thought they would run over him, or past
      him; but no, at ten yards distant they were all at the sail, and had it
      down like lightning; and then Flucker sprang to the bows, the other boy to
      the helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, there were but two Johnstones in the boat; and this boy, in
      his hurry, actually put the helm to port, instead of to starboard.
      Christie, who stood amidships, saw the error; she sprang aft, flung the
      boy from the helm and jammed it hard-a-starboard with her foot. The boat
      answered the helm, but too late for Flucker; the man was four yards from
      him as the boat drifted by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's a deed mon!" cried Liston, on shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat's length gave one more little chance; the after-part must drift
      nearer him&mdash;thanks to Christie. Flucker flew aft; flung himself on
      his back, and seized his sister's petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fling yourself ower the gunwale," screamed he. "Ye'll no hurt; I'se haud
      ye."
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself boldly over the gunwale; the man was sinking, her nails
      touched his hair, her fingers entangled themselves in it, she gave him a
      powerful wrench and brought him alongside; the boys pinned him like
      wild-cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie darted away forward to the mast, passed a rope round it, threw it
      the boys, in a moment it was under his shoulders. Christie hauled on it
      from the fore thwart, the boys lifted him, and they tumbled him, gasping
      and gurgling like a dying salmon, into the bottom of the boat, and flung
      net and jackets and sail over him to keep the life in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! draw your breath all hands at sea and ashore, and don't try it again,
      young gentleman, for there was nothing to spare; when you were missed at
      the bow two stout hearts quivered for you; Lord Ipsden hid his face in his
      two hands, Sandy Liston gave a groan, and, when you were grabbed astern,
      jumped out of his boat and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A gill o' whisky for ony favor, for it's turned me as seeck as a doeg."
      He added: "He may bless yon lassie's fowr banes, for she's ta'en him oot
      o' Death's maw, as sure as Gude's in heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Barbara, who had all her life been longing to see perilous
      adventures, prayed and trembled and cried most piteously; and Lord
      Ipsden's back was to her, and he paid no attention to her voice; but when
      the battle was won, and Lord Ipsden turned and saw her, she clung to his
      arm and dried her tears; and then the Old Town cheered the boat, and the
      New Town cheered the boat, and the towns cheered each other; and the
      Johnstones, lad and lass, set their sail, and swept back in triumph to the
      pier; so then Lady Barbara's blood mounted and tingled in her veins like
      fire. "Oh, how noble!" cried she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dearest," said Ipsden. "You have seen something great done at last;
      and by a woman, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Barbara, "how beautiful! oh! how beautiful it all is; only the
      next one I see I should like the danger to be over first, that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys and Christie, the moment they had saved Gatty, up sail again for
      Newhaven; they landed in about three minutes at the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      TIME. From Newhaven town to pier on foot: 1 m. 30 sec. First tack: 5 m. 30
      sec. Second tack, and getting him on board: 4 m. 0 sec. Back to the pier,
      going free: 3 m. 30 sec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Total: 14 m. 30 sec.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came in to the pier, Christie sitting quietly on the thwart after her
      work, the boy steering, and Flucker standing against the mast, hands in
      his pockets; the deportment this young gentleman thought fit to assume on
      this occasion was "complete apathy"; he came into port with the air of one
      bringing home the ordinary results of his day's fishing; this was, I
      suppose, to impress the spectators with the notion that saving lives was
      an every-day affair with La Famille Johnstone; as for Gatty, he came to
      himself under his heap of nets and jackets and spoke once between Death's
      jaw and the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful!" murmured he, and was silent. The meaning of this observation
      never transpired, and never will in this world. Six months afterward,
      being subjected to a searching interrogatory, he stated that he had
      alluded to the majesty and freedom of a certain <i>pose</i> Christie had
      adopted while hailing him from the boat; but, reader, if he had wanted you
      and me to believe it was this, he should not have been half a year finding
      it out&mdash;<i>increduli odimus!</i> They landed, and Christie sprang on
      shore; while she was wending her way through the crowd, impeded by
      greetings and acclamations, with every now and then a lass waving her
      kerchief or a lad his bonnet over the heroine's head, poor Mrs. Gatty was
      receiving the attention of the New Town; they brought her to, they told
      her the good news&mdash;she thanked God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole story had spread like wildfire; they expostulated with her, they
      told her now was the time to show she had a heart, and bless the young
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rewarded them with a valuable precept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind your own business!" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! y' are a dour wife!" cried Newhaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dour wife bent her eyes on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people were still collected at the foot of the street, but they were
      now in knots, when in dashed Flucker, arriving by a short cut, and crying:
      "She does na ken, she does na ken, she was ower moedest to look, I daur
      say, and ye'll no tell her, for he's a blackguard, an' he's just making a
      fule o' the puir lass, and if she kens what she has done for him, she'll
      be fonder o' him than a coow o' her cauf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Flucker! we maun tell her, it's her lad, her ain lad, she saved,"
      expostulated a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did ever my feyther do a good turn till ye?" cried Flucker. "Awel, then,
      ye'll no tell the lassie, she's weel as she is; he's gaun t' Enngland the
      day. I cannie gie ye a' a hidin'," said he, with an eye that flashed
      volumes of good intention on a hundred and fifty people; "but I am
      feytherless and motherless, an' I can fa' on my knees an' curse ye a' if
      ye do us sic an ill turn, an' then ye'll see whether ye'll thrive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll no tell, Flucker, ye need na curse us ony way."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, with all the sharp authority of a skipper, ordered Master
      Flucker to the pier, with a message to the yacht; Flucker <i>qua</i>
      yachtsman was a machine, and went as a matter of course. "I am determined
      to tell her," said Lord Ipsden to Lady Barbara.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," remonstrated Lady Barbara, "the poor boy says he will curse us if
      we do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't curse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the little blackguard's grog would be stopped on board the yacht
      if he did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker had not been gone many minutes before loud cheering was heard, and
      Christie Johnstone appeared convoyed by a large detachment of the Old
      Town; she had tried to slip away, but they would not let her. They
      convoyed her in triumph till they saw the New Town people, and then they
      turned and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in among the groups, a changed woman&mdash;her pallor and her
      listlessness were gone&mdash;the old light was in her eye, and the bright
      color in her cheek, and she seemed hardly to touch the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm just droukit, lasses," cried she, gayly, wringing her sleeve. Every
      eye was upon her; did she know, or did she not know, what she had done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden stepped forward; the people tacitly accepted him as the
      vehicle of their curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was it, Christie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dinna ken, for my pairt!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gatty came out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A handsome young fellow, I hope, Christie?" resumed Lord Ipsden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye maun ask Flucker," was the reply. "I could no tak muckle notice, ye
      ken," putting her hand before her eye, and half smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! I hear he is very good-looking; and I hear you think so, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      She glided to him and looked in his face. He gave a meaning smile. The
      poor girl looked quite perplexed. Suddenly she gave a violent start.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Christie! where is Christie?" had cried a well-known voice. He had
      learned on the pier who had saved him&mdash;he had slipped up among the
      boats to find her&mdash;he could not find his hat&mdash;he could not wait
      for it&mdash;his dripping hair showed where he had been&mdash;it was her
      love whom she had just saved out of Death's very jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a cry of love that went through every heart, high or low, young
      or old, that heard it. And she went to him, through the air it seemed;
      but, quick as she was, another was as quick; the mother had seen him
      first, and she was there. Christie saw nothing. With another cry, the very
      keynote of her great and loving heart, she flung her arms round&mdash;Mrs.
      Gatty, who was on the same errand as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hearts are not steel, and steel is bent; Hearts are not flint, and flint
      is rent."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman felt Christie touch her. She turned from her son in a moment
      and wept upon her neck. Her lover took her hand and kissed it, and pressed
      it to his bosom, and tried to speak to her; but all he could do was to sob
      and choke&mdash;and kiss her hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter!" sobbed the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that word Christie clasped her quickly; and then Christie began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not a stone," cried Mrs. Gatty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave him life; but you have saved him from death. Oh, Charles, never
      make her repent what she has done for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a woman, after all; and prudence and prejudice melted like snow
      before her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were not many dry eyes&mdash;least of all the heroic Lady Barbara's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three whom a moment had made one were becoming calmer, and taking one
      another's hands for life, when a diabolical sound arose&mdash;and what was
      it but Sandy Liston, who, after furious resistance, was blubbering with
      explosive but short-lived violence? Having done it, he was the first to
      draw everybody's attention to the phenomenon; and affecting to consider it
      a purely physical attack, like a <i>coup de soleil,</i> or so on, he
      proceeded instantly to Drysel's for his panacea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Barbara enjoined Lord Ipsden to watch these people, and not to lose a
      word they said; and, after she had insisted upon kissing Christie, she
      went off to her carriage. And she too was so happy, she cried three
      distinct times on her way to Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden, having reminded Gatty of his engagement, begged him to add
      his mother and Christie to the party, and escorted Lady Barbara to her
      phaeton.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then the people dispersed by degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That old lady's face seems familiar to me," said Lord Ipsden, as he stood
      on the little natural platform by the "Peacock." "Do you know who she is,
      Saunders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Peggy, that was cook in your lordship's uncle's time, my lord. She
      married a green-grocer," added Saunders, with an injured air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! hech!" cried Flucker, "Christie has ta'en up her head wi' a cook's
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gatty was ushered into the "Peacock" with mock civility by Mr.
      Saunders. No recognition took place, each being ashamed of the other as an
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next arrival was a beautiful young lady in a black silk gown, a plain
      but duck-like plaid shawl, who proved to be Christie Johnstone, in her
      Sunday attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they met, Mrs. Gatty gave a little scream of joy, and said: "Oh, my
      child; if I had seen you in that dress, I should never have said a word
      against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pars minima est ipsa puella sui!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship stepped up to her, took off his hat, and said: "Will Mrs.
      Gatty take from me a commission for two pictures, as big as herself, and
      as bonny?" added he, doing a little Scotch. He handed her a check; and,
      turning to Gatty, added, "At your convenience, sir, <i>bien entendu."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! it's for five hundred pund, Chairles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gear gangs in little book,"* said Jean.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *Bulk.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Ay, does it," replied Flucker, assuming the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord!" said the artist, "you treat Art like a prince; and she shall
      treat you like a queen. When the sun comes out again, I will work for you
      and fame. You shall have two things painted, every stroke loyally in the
      sunlight. In spite of gloomy winter and gloomier London, I will try if I
      can't hang nature and summer on your walls forever. As for me, you know I
      must go to Gerard Dow and Cuyp, and Pierre de Hoogh, when my little sand
      is run; but my handwriting shall warm your children's children's hearts,
      sir, when this hand is dust." His eye turned inward, he walked to and fro,
      and his companions died out of his sight&mdash;he was in the kingdom of
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship and Jean entered the "Peacock," followed by Flucker, who
      merely lingered at the door to moralize as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hech! hech! isna thaat lamentable? Christie's mon's as daft as a drunk
      weaver."
    </p>
    <p>
      But one stayed quietly behind, and assumed that moment the office of her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay!" he burst out again, "the resources of our art are still unfathomed!
      Pictures are yet to be painted that shall refresh men's inner souls, and
      help their hearts against the artificial world; and charm the fiend away,
      like David's harp!! The world, after centuries of lies, will give nature
      and truth a trial. What a paradise art will be, when truths, instead of
      lies, shall be told on paper, on marble, on canvas, and on the boards!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dinner's on the boarrd," murmured Christie, alluding to Lord Ipsden's
      breakfast; "and I hae the charge o' ye," pulling his sleeve hard enough to
      destroy the equilibrium of a flea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then don't let us waste our time here. Oh, Christie!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What est, my laddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so preciously hungry!!!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "C-way* then!"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Come away.
</pre>
    <p>
      Off they ran, hand in hand, sparks of beauty, love and happiness flying
      all about them.

      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "THERE is nothing but meeting and parting in this world!" and you may be
      sure the incongruous personages of our tale could not long be together.
      Their separate paths had met for an instant in one focus, furnished then
      and there the matter of an eccentric story, and then diverged forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our lives have a general current, and also an episode or two; and the
      episodes of a commonplace life are often rather startling; in like manner
      this tale is not a specimen, but an episode of Lord Ipsden and Lady
      Barbara, who soon after this married and lived like the rest of the <i>beau
      monde.</i> In so doing, they passed out of my hands; such as wish to know
      how viscounts and viscountesses feed and sleep, and do the domestic (so
      called), and the social (so called), are referred to the fashionable
      novel. To Mr. Saunders, for instance, who has in the press one of those
      cerberus-leviathans of fiction, so common now; incredible as folio to
      future ages. Saunders will take you by the hand, and lead you over carpets
      two inches thick&mdash;under rosy curtains&mdash;to dinner-tables. He will
      <i>fete</i> you, and opera you, and dazzle your young imagination with <i>e'p'ergnes,</i>
      and salvers, and buhl and ormolu. No fishwives or painters shall intrude
      upon his polished scenes; all shall be as genteel as himself. Saunders is
      a good authority; he is more in the society, and far more in the
      confidence of the great, than most fashionable novelists. Mr. Saunders's
      work will be in three volumes; nine hundred and ninety pages!!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, this single work of this ingenious writer will equal in
      bulk the aggregate of all the writings extant by Moses, David, Solomon,
      Isaiah, and St. Paul!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not venture into competition with this behemoth of the <i>salon;</i>
      I will evaporate in thin generalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Ipsden then lived very happily with Lady Barbara, whose hero he
      straightway became, and who nobly and poetically dotes upon him. He has
      gone into political life to please her, and will remain there&mdash;to
      please himself. They were both very grateful to Newhaven; when they
      married they vowed to visit it twice a year, and mingle a fortnight's
      simple life with its simple scenes; but four years have passed, and they
      have never been there again, and I dare say never will; but when Viscount
      Ipsden falls in with a brother aristocrat who is crushed by the fiend <i>ennui,</i>
      he remembers Aberford, and condenses his famous recipe into a two-edged
      hexameter, which will make my learned reader laugh, for it is full of
      wisdom:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diluculo surgas! miseris succurrere discas!!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Flucker Johnstone meditated during breakfast upon the five hundred pounds,
      and regretted he had not years ago adopted Mr. Gatty's profession; some
      days afterward he invited his sister to a conference. Chairs being set,
      Mr. Flucker laid down this observation, that near relations should be
      deuced careful not to cast discredit upon one another; that now his sister
      was to be a lady, it was repugnant to his sense of right to be a fisherman
      and make her ladyship blush for him; on the contrary, he felt it his duty
      to rise to such high consideration that she should be proud of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie acquiesced at once in this position, but professed herself
      embarrassed to know how such a "ne'er-do-weel" was to be made a source of
      pride; then she kissed Flucker, and said, in a tone somewhat inconsistent
      with the above, "Tell me, my laamb!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lamb informed her that the sea has many paths; some of them
      disgraceful, such as line or net fishing, and the periodical laying down,
      on rocky shoals, and taking up again, of lobster-creels; others, superior
      to anything the dry land can offer in importance and dignity and general
      estimation, such as the command of a merchant vessel trading to the East
      or West Indies. Her lamb then suggested that if she would be so good as to
      launch him in the merchant-service, with a good rig of clothes and money
      in his pocket, there was that in his head which would enable him to work
      to windward of most of his contemporaries. He bade her calculate upon the
      following results: In a year or two he would be second mate, and next year
      first mate, and in a few years more skipper! Think of that, lass! Skipper
      of a vessel, whose rig he generously left his sister free to determine;
      premising that two masts were, in his theory of navigation, indispensable,
      and that three were a great deal more like Cocker than two. This led to a
      general consultation; Flucker's ambition was discussed and praised. That
      modest young gentleman, in spite of many injunctions to the contrary,
      communicated his sister's plans for him to Lord Ipsden, and affected to
      doubt their prudence. The bait took; Lord Ipsden wrote to his man of
      business, and an unexpected blow fell upon the ingenious Flucker. He was
      sent to school; there to learn a little astronomy, a little navigation, a
      little seamanship, a little manners, etc.; in the mysteries of reading and
      writing his sister had already perfected him by dint of "the taws." This
      school was a blow; but Flucker was no fool; he saw there was no way of
      getting from school to sea without working. So he literally worked out to
      sea. His first voyage was distinguished by the following peculiarities:
      Attempts to put tricks upon this particular novice generally ended in the
      laugh turning against the experimenters; and instead of drinking his grog,
      which he hates, he secreted it, and sold it for various advantages. He has
      been now four voyages. When he comes ashore, instead of going to haunts of
      folly and vice, he instantly bears up for his sister's house&mdash;Kensington
      Gravel-pits&mdash;which he makes in the following manner: He goes up the
      river&mdash;Heaven knows where all&mdash;this he calls running down the
      longitude; then he lands, and bears down upon the Gravel-pits; in
      particular knowledge of the names of streets he is deficient, but he knows
      the exact bearings of Christie's dwelling. He tacks and wears according as
      masonry compels him, and he arrives at the gate. He hails the house, in a
      voice that brings all the inhabitants of the row to their windows,
      including Christie; he is fallen upon and dragged into the house. The
      first thing is, he draws out from his boots, and his back, and other
      hiding-places, China crape and marvelous silk handkerchiefs for Christie;
      and she takes from his pocket a mass of Oriental sugar-plums, with which,
      but for this precaution, she knows by experience he would poison young
      Charley; and soon he is to be seen sitting with his hand in his sister's,
      and she lookng like a mother upon his handsome, weather-beaten face, and
      Gatty opposite, adoring him as a specimen of male beauty, and sometimes
      making furtive sketches of him. And then the tales he always brings with
      him; the house is never very dull, but it is livelier than ever when this
      inexhaustible sailor casts anchor in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends (chiefly artists) who used to leave at 9:30, stay till eleven;
      for an intelligent sailor is better company than two lawyers, two bishops,
      three soldiers, and four writers of plays and tales, all rolled together.
      And still he tells Christie he shall command a vessel some day, and leads
      her to the most cheering inferences from the fact of his prudence and his
      general width-awake; in particular he bids her contrast with him the
      general fate of sailors, eaten up by land-sharks, particularly of the
      female gender, whom he demonstrates to be the worst enemies poor Jack has;
      he calls these sunken rocks, fire-ships and other metaphors. He concludes
      thus: "You are all the lass I mean to have till I'm a skipper, and then
      I'll bear up alongside some pretty, decent lass, like yourself, Christie,
      and we'll sail in company all our lives, let the wind blow high or low."
      Such is the gracious Flucker become in his twentieth year. Last voyage,
      with Christie's aid, he produced a sextant of his own, and "made it twelve
      o'clock" (with the sun's consent, I hope), and the eyes of authority fell
      upon him. So, who knows? perhaps he may one day, sail a ship; and, if he
      does, he will be prouder and happier than if we made him monarch of the
      globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to our chiefs; Mrs. Gatty gave her formal consent to her son's
      marriage with Christie Johnstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were examples. Aristocracy had ere now condescended to wealth; earls
      had married women rich by tallow-importing papas; and no doubt, had these
      same earls been consulted in Gatty's case, they would have decided that
      Christie Johnstone, with her real and funded property, was not a
      villainous match for a green grocer's son, without a rapp;* but Mrs. Gatty
      did not reason so, did not reason at all, luckily, her heart ran away with
      her judgment, and, her judgment ceasing to act, she became a wise woman.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *A diminutive German coin.
</pre>
    <p>
      The case was peculiar. Gatty was a artist <i>pur sang</i>&mdash;and
      Christie, who would not have been the wife for a <i>petit maitre,</i> was
      the wife of wives for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted a beautiful wife to embellish his canvas, disfigured hitherto by
      an injudicious selection of models; a virtuous wife to be his crown; a
      prudent wife to save him from ruin; a cheerful wife to sustain his
      spirits, drooping at times by virtue of his artist's temperament; an
      intellectual wife to preserve his children from being born dolts and bred
      dunces, and to keep his own mind from sharpening to one point, and so
      contracting and becoming monomaniacal. And he found all these qualities,
      together with the sun and moon of human existence&mdash;true love and true
      religion&mdash;in Christie Johnstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In similar cases, foolish men have set to work to make, in six months,
      their diamond of nature, the exact cut and gloss of other men's pastes,
      and, nervously watching the process, have suffered torture; luckily
      Charles Gatty was not wise enough for this; he saw nature had
      distinguished her he loved beyond her fellows; here, as elsewhere, he had
      faith in nature&mdash;he believed that Christie would charm everybody of
      eye, and ear, and mind, and heart, that approached her; he admired her as
      she was, and left her to polish herself, if she chose. He did well; she
      came to London with a fine mind, a broad brogue, a delicate ear; she
      observed how her husband's friends spoke, and in a very few months she had
      toned down her Scotch to a rich Ionic coloring, which her womanly instinct
      will never let her exchange for the thin, vinegar accents that are too
      prevalent in English and French society; and in other respects she caught,
      by easy gradation, the tone of the new society to which her marriage
      introduced her, without, however, losing her charming self.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wise dowager lodges hard by, having resisted an invitation to be in
      the same house; she comes to that house to assist the young wife with her
      experience, and to be welcome&mdash;not to interfere every minute, and
      tease her; she loves her daughter-in-law almost as much as she does her
      son, and she is happy because he bids fair to be an immortal painter, and,
      above all, a gentleman; and she, a wifely wife, a motherly mother, and,
      above all, a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is a happy couple. Their life is full of purpose and industry,
      yet lightened by gayety; they go to operas, theaters and balls, for they
      are young. They have plenty of society, real society, not the ill-assorted
      collection of a predetermined number of bodies, that blindly assumes that
      name, but the rich communication of various and fertile minds; they very,
      very seldom consent to squat four mortal hours on one chair (like old
      hares stiffening in their hot forms), and nibbling, sipping and twaddling
      in four mortal hours what could have been eaten, drunken and said in
      thirty-five minutes. They are both artists at heart, and it shocks their
      natures to see folks mix so very largely the <i>inutile</i> with the <i>insipidum,</i>
      and waste, at one huge but barren incubation, the soul, and the stomach,
      and the irrevocable hours, things with which so much is to be done. But
      they have many desirable acquaintances, and not a few friends; the latter
      are mostly lovers of truth in their several departments, and in all
      things. Among them are painters, sculptors, engineers, writers,
      conversers, thinkers; these acknowledging, even in England, other gods
      besides the intestines, meet often <i>chez</i> Gatty, chiefly for mental
      intercourse; a cup of tea with such is found, by experience, to be better
      than a stalled elk where chit-chat reigns over the prostrate hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is a happy couple; the very pigeons and the crows need not
      blush for the nest at Kensington Gravel-pits. There the divine institution
      Marriage takes its natural colors, and it is at once pleasant and good to
      catch such glimpses of Heaven's design, and sad to think how often this
      great boon, accorded by God to man and woman, must have been abused and
      perverted, ere it could have sunk to be the standing butt of
      farce-writers, and the theme of weekly punsters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this pair we see the wonders a male and female can do for each other in
      the sweet bond of holy wedlock. In that blessed relation alone two
      interests are really one, and two hearts lie safe at anchor side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie and Charles are friends&mdash;for they are man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie and Charles are lovers still&mdash;for they are man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christie and Charles are one forever&mdash;for they are man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wife brightens the house, from kitchen to garret, for her husband;
      this husband works like a king for his wife's comfort, and for his own
      fame&mdash;and that fame is his wife's glory. When one of these expresses
      or hints a wish, the other's first impulse is to find the means, not the
      objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      They share all troubles, and, by sharing, halve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They share all pleasures, and, by sharing, double them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They climb the hill together now, and many a canty day they shall have
      with one another; and when, by the inevitable law, they begin to descend
      toward the dark valley, they will still go hand in hand, smiling so
      tenderly, and supporting each other with a care more lovely than when the
      arm was strong and the foot firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these two temperate lives old age will descend lightly, gradually,
      gently, and late&mdash;and late upon these evergreen hearts, because they
      are not tuned to some selfish, isolated key; these hearts beat and ring
      with the young hearts of their dear children, and years hence papa and
      mamma will begin life hopefully, wishfully, warmly again with each loved
      novice in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when old age does come, it will be no calamity to these, as it is to
      you, poor battered beau, laughed at by the fair ninnies who erst laughed
      with you; to you, poor follower of salmon, fox, and pheasant, whose joints
      are stiffening, whose nerve is gone&mdash;whose Golgotha remains; to you,
      poor faded beauty, who have staked all upon man's appetite, and not
      accumulated goodness or sense for your second course; to you, poor
      drawing-room wit, whose sarcasm has turned to venom and is turning to
      drivel.
    </p>
    <p>
      What terrors has old age for this happy pair? it cannot make them ugly,
      for, though the purple light of youth recedes, a new kind of tranquil
      beauty, the aloe-blossom of many years of innocence, comes to, and sits
      like a dove upon, the aged faces, where goodness, sympathy and
      intelligence have harbored together so long; and where evil passions have
      flitted (for we are all human), but found no resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old age is no calamity to them. It cannot terrify them; for ere they had
      been married a week the woman taught the man, lover of truth, to search
      for the highest and greatest truths in a book written for men's souls by
      the Author of the world, the sea, the stars, the sun, the soul; and this
      book, <i>Dei gratia,</i> will, as the good bishop sings,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Teach them to live that they may dread The grave as little as their bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot make them sad, for, ere it comes loved souls will have gone from
      earth and from their tender bosom, but not from their memories; and will
      seem to beckon them now across the cold valley to the golden land.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot make them sad, for on earth the happiest must drink a sorrowful
      cup more than once in a long life, and so their brightest hopes will have
      come to dwell habitually on things beyond the grave; and the great
      painter, <i>jam Senex,</i> will chiefly meditate upon a richer landscape
      and brighter figures than human hand has ever painted; a scene whose
      glories he can see from hence but by glimpses and through a glass darkly;
      the great meadows on the other side of Jordan, which are bright with the
      spirits of the just that walk there, and are warmed with an eternal sun,
      and ring with the triumph of the humble and the true, and the praises of
      God forever.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
